        <div class="col s12 m7">
        
            <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Holden's story begins at Pencey Prep, his prep school in Pennsylvania. He is at a Pencey football game and is soon to leave the school, as he was expelled for failing all his classes except English. He decides not to return home until Wednesday so his parents find out about his expulsion and digest it before he arrives. Holden goes to his history teacher's house (Mr. Spencer). Eventually, Mr. Spencer shows Holden a test that he failed and irritates Holden by asking about things like whether he is concerned for his future or not. This causes Holden to leave and go back to his Pencey dorm room.</p>

            <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Back at his dorm room, Holden is interrupted by Ackley, his dorm neighbor. Holden criticizes Ackley for his disgusting appearance and behavior. For instance, Ackley starts clipping his nails right on the floor of Holden's room, despite Holden asking him to do it over a table multiple times. Holden's roommate, Stradlater, is also introduced. Stradlater is going on a date with Jane Gallagher, a girl that Holden spent a lot of time with during the summer and feels a deep personal connection to. Holden worries that Stradlater will try to have sex with Jane due to his sexual nature and experience.</p>

            <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Stradlater also asks Holden to write an English composition for him while he's gone, and Holden writes about his dead brother Allie's baseball mitt, and the poems written on it. When Stradlater comes back, he is disappointed by the composition. Holden asks if Stradlater had sex with Jane but Stradlater is evasive and doesn't answer the question concretely. This causes Holden to get in a fight with Stradlater, and Holden loses easily.</p>

            <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Shortly after this, Holden is sick of Pencey and decides to leave early. He takes a train to New York City, where he plans to stay in a hotel for the next few days before returning home. On the train, he meets the mother of Ernest Morrow, another student from Pencey who Holden detests. Holden lies about Ernest to his mother, claiming he is popular and respected.</p>

            <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Holden then takes a cab to the Edmont Hotel. Right away, Holden sees other rooms outside his window with crossdressers and people squirting water into each others mouths. Holden decides to call a woman named Faith Cavendish who he doesn't know, but he has heard that she offers sex once in a while. Holden hangs up in the end without arranging anything.</p>

            <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Holden goes down to the Lavender Room in the hotel and orders drinks, but the waiter realizes he is a minor and is hesitant to serve him. Holden starts dancing with 3 women from out of town, and they eventually leave.</p>

            <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Holden goes back to the hotel lobby where he starts reflecting on how he met Jane and the time he spent with her during a summer in Maine. One thing he remembers is when they were playing checkers on the patio and Jane's stepdad asked her where the cigarettes are. Jane didn't reply and started crying, and Holden tried to comfort her.</p>

            <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Eventually, Holden leaves the hotel and goes to Ernie's, a club he and his older brother used to visit frequently. Holden criticizes Ernie's over-the-top attitude and piano playing, and the other people's praise of Ernie and his skill. Holden eventually runs into one of his older brother's former girlfriends that he does not want to sit with, so he leaves the club and goes back to his hotel.</p>

            <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Back at the hotel, while Holden is going up to his room, the elevator operator offers to send a prostitute to Holden's room for $5, which Holden accepts. When the prostitute, Sunny, comes, Holden is nervous, depressed, and doesn't feel like having sex with her. He tries to make conversation with Sunny and fails. Eventually, he pays Sunny the $5, but Sunny claims that the price is actually $10. Holden refuses to pay the extra $5 and Sunny goes away. Later, Sunny and the elevator operator come back to take the extra $5. The elevator operator punches and restrains Holden, and Sunny takes another $5 from his wallet. He eventually goes to sleep.</p>

            <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">The next morning, Holden makes a matinee date with Sally Hayes, a girl he used to date in the past. In the meantime, he eats breakfast at a sandwich place. He meets two nuns there, and strikes up a conversation with them about <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>. He gives them $10 as a donation. After breakfast, he also buys a record called "Little Shirley Beans" for his 10-year old sister, Phoebe, and he thinks she will like it.</p>

            <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">During the date, Holden and Sally watch the play. Holden is upset as Sally starts talking to a boy from Andover that she knows about meaningless stuff. Sally suggests they go ice skating, but they are bad at it and decide to sit at a table instead. Holden starts rambling about how he hates society and its artificialness, and impulsively urges Sally to run away with him to the woods and get married. Sally refuses and Holden eventually calls her a "pain in the ass", and laughs at her when she cries about it. This ends their date.</p>

            <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Afterwards, Holden calls Carl Luce, an advisor he had known from a previous prep school called Whooton School. Holden invited Carl Luce to have drinks at the Wicker Bar in a hotel. Holden tries to talk to Luce about his relationship, sex, and homosexuals. Carl Luce is irritated by this immaturity, causing him to leave early. Holden continues drinking and gets very drunk.</p>

                 <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">While being very drunk, Holden calls Sally and incoherently rambles about their Christmas Eve plans. Eventually, he decides to sneak home and talk to his sister Phoebe. Phoebe figures out that Holden got expelled again, and is upset by it. She also calls him out for not liking anything and being immature. Holden ends up asking for some of Phoebe's money and leaves to stay at his previous English teacher's apartment (Mr. Antolini).</p>

            <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">At his apartment, Mr. Antolini discusses Holden's expulsion and his future with him. Holden is tired and ends up sleeping on the couch. Holden eventually wakes up to find Mr. Antolini patting him. Holden feels like Mr. Antolini is a homosexual because of this and leaves. He ends up sleeping on a bench at Grand Central Station.</p>

            <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Later, Holden sends Phoebe a note through her school to meet him at the museum during lunchtime. The note mentions that he is going to hitch hike out west. Phoebe arrives with a suitcase of clothes and begs Holden to bring her with him, but Holden refuses and Phoebe gets upset and doesn't speak to him. Holden walks to the zoo knowing the Phoebe will follow him, and ends up buying her a ride on a carousel. Holden is very happy seeing her ride it.</p>

            <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">The story ends here and Holden says that he won't talk about the rest of the story in which he becomes "sick". He mentions that he has a psychoanalyst here, asking Holden whether he will apply himself next year in school. He briefly reflects on how he missed all the people he talked about, even Stradlater, Ackley, and Maurice. Then the book ends.</p>
