				<h3>The "Little Shirley Beans" Record</h3>
				
				<p class="light" style="font-size:18px">The "Little Shirley Beans" record is another symbol of Holden's grasp on his childhood and resistance to growing up, and when the record shatters, it's the end of Holden's dream of resisting adulthood. To prove this, let's look at the quote in chapter 16 where Holden first introduces the record. After eating breakfast with the nuns, Holden goes out to buy the record in Broadway and describes it:</p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:14px;text-indent:25px">"It was about a little kid that wouldn't go out of the house because two of her front teeth were out and she was ashamed to... She sings it very Dixieland and whorehouse, and it doesn't sound at all mushy." (Salinger 114-115)</p>

            </div>
            <div class="card-content">
              <p class="white-text">A depiction of the Little Shirley Beans record</p>
            </div>
          </div>


		  </div>
		  

      <div class="row">
      <div class="col s12 m12">
         <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">The song is about a girl that was ashamed of her teeth falling out. The thing about teeth falling out (and being replaced) is that it's a normal part of childhood. In fact, the two front teeth described here that the girl had lost ("two of her front teeth were out") could be referring to her central incisors, two prominent front teeth that commonly fall out and get replaced during childhood. So since the girl is ashamed of this common change and part of growing up, it could show that this record is supposed to be about a girl who is resistant to growing up and ashamed by it. This connects to Holden's own resistance to growing up and grasp on childhood which is explained and proven on the <a href="../../content/main/bildungsroman.html">Bildungsroman page</a>. Since there is a connection between the girl's resistance to growth and Holden's, the record as a whole could symbolize Holden's grasp on childhood. </p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Adding on to this, he mentions that the way the singer sings the song makes the record not "sound at all mushy". By the record not being "mushy", he means that the signing doesn't sound artificial or exaggerated. He appreciates this because he doesn't like artificial/phony people, behaviors, and things. Artificialness is associated with adulthood and he's glad non-phony things like this record are true to themselves the way a child is before being exposed to society and losing their identity.</p>


        <h5>The Record Shattering</h5>
        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Based on the previous explanation of what the record symbolizes, when Holden's record shatters, it means his desire to hold on to his childhood and resist maturing is falling apart. Here's the quote where his record shatters:</p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:14px;text-indent:25px">"Then something terrible happened just as I got in the park. I dropped old Phoebe's record. It broke into about fifty pieces... I damn near cried, it made me feel terrible, but all I did was, I took the pieces out of the envelope and put them in my coat pocket. They weren't good for anything, but I didn't feel like just throwing them away." (Salinger 154)</p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">When Holden says "something terrible happened" and "I damn near cried, it made me feel terrible", he is showing how upset he is that he's losing his grasp on his childhood and how badly he wants to resist adulthood. It has a big, negative effect on him when he starts to lose his childhood. He also says he put the pieces back into his coat pocket and "didn't feel like just throwing them away". This means that although he's lost his grasp on childhood, he's still trying to hold onto some of it as he matures. Many people use expressions like "the child inside me" or "inner child" which refer to the idea that someone still is holding on to some of their childhood behaviors or tendencies even after growing into adulthood. This is what Holden is trying to accomplish when he puts the pieces back in his pocket and doesn't throw them away.</p>

        <h3>Phoebe's Notebook</h3>
        
        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Phoebe's notebook is a symbol representing the non-phoniness and non-corruption of children, which is something Holden greatly values. To explain this, let's look at the excerpt about Phoebe's notebook. Holden snuck into his house and is about to wake Phoebe up, but starts reading a notebook Phoebe has on a desk: </p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:14px;text-indent:25px;line-height:80%">"She
        has about five thousand notebooks. You never saw a kid with so many notebooks. I
        opened the one on top and looked at the first page. It had on it:
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
         Bernice meet me at recess I have something
         very very important to tell you.
         <br></br>
         <br></br>
         That was all there was on that page. The next one had on it:
         <br></br>
         <br></br>
         Why has south eastern Alaska so many caning factories?
         <br></br>
         Because theres so much salmon
         <br></br>
         Why has it valuable forests?
         <br></br>
         because it has the right climate.
         <br></br>
         What has our government done to make
         <br></br>
         life easier for the alaskan eskimos?
         <br></br>
         look it up for tomorrow!!!
         <br></br>
         Phoebe Weatherfield Caulfield
         <br></br>
         Phoebe Weatherfield Caulfield
         <br></br>
         Phoebe Weatherfield Caulfield
         <br></br>
         Phoebe W. Caulfield
         <br></br>
         Phoebe Weatherfield Caulfield, Esq.
         <br></br>
         Please pass to Shirley!!!!
         <br></br>
         Shirley you said you were sagitarius
         <br></br>
         but your only taurus bring your skates
         <br></br>
         when you come over to my house
         <br></br>
         <br></br>
         I sat there on D.B.'s desk and read the whole notebook. It didn't take me long, and
        I can read that kind of stuff, some kid's notebook, Phoebe's or anybody's, all day and all night 
        <br></br>
        long. Kid's notebooks kill me." (Salinger 160-161)</p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">From this quote, it is evident that Phoebe's notebook is a straightforward, clear expression of her thoughts, almost like a stream of conciousness. She has reminders in it such as "What has our government done to make life easier...look it up for tomorrow!!!". She has written notes to her friends such as "Bernice meet me at recess I have something... important to tell you", or "Shirley you said... bring your skates when you come over to my house". All of these things are just her plain thoughts written down. She also has grammar errors such as "Why has south eastern Alaska so many..." and "Why has it valuable forests?". All of these details make the notebook very informal and non-serious, with straightforward thoughts. There is no deep meaning or artificialness in this. Phoebe's notebook, therefore, is very non-phony. </p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Holden goes on to say "I can read that kind of stuff, some kid's notebook, Phoebe's or anybody's, all day and all night long. Kid's notebooks kill me". He explicitly is saying that he appreciates kid's notebooks and loves reading them. Based on the non-phoniness of Phoebe's writing, it's clear why he likes kid's notebooks. Since he doesn't like phoniness and artifical language, he is happy to see children writing what they are thinking freely, free from "corruption". This also means he likes childhood and children in general, appreciating them for being true to themselves and not being corrupted by society yet. That's why he wants to protect children from falling into adulthood (Discussed on <a href="../../content/main/bildungsroman.html">the Bildungsroman page</a>). He's trying to preserve their free thinking, innocence, and truth to themselves before they can get exposed to adulthood and get corrupted.</p>

        <h3>The F*** You Signs (Graffiti)</h3>
        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">The F*** you signs on the walls in Phoebe's school and at the museum are symbols of the inevitability of growing up and they serve to contradict Holden's simplistic view of children being innocent and adults being vulgar and corrupt. To explain this, let's first look at the quote where Holden finds the F words written on staircase walls in Phoebe's school:</p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:14px;text-indent:25px">"Somebody'd written "F*** you" on
the wall. It drove me damn near crazy. I thought how Phoebe and all the other little kids
would see it... I figured it was some perverty bum that'd sneaked in the school late
at night to take a leak or something and then wrote it on the wall" (Salinger 201)</p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">The important thing here is that Holden says "I figured it was some perverty bum that'd sneaked in the school late at night to take a leak or something and then wrote it on the wall". Holden is suggesting that it was some random adult that came in and wrote the graffiti late at night. In reality, it was most likely a student at that school- even at the elementary school age, kids can often write graffiti and vulgar language like that, especially in bathrooms. Holden figures it's an adult who wrote the F word because of his general view of adults vs. children. He thinks adults are corrupted, and are exposed to reality and vulgar language like this. On the other hand, he thinks children are always innocent and good. Since it's most likely a student who wrote the F words, the F*** you graffiti contradicts his view and points out that it's incorrect, exposing a problem in Holden's way of thinking.  </p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Here's another example from the museum that shows this same idea. Holden is in a tomb and finds a F*** you written on the wall:</p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:14px;text-indent:25px">"I was the only one left in the tomb then. I sort of liked it, in a way. It was so nice
        and peaceful. Then, all of a sudden, you'd never guess what I saw on the wall. Another
        'F*** you.' It was written with a red crayon or something, right under the glass part of
        the wall, under the stones" (Salinger 204)</p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Here, the important thing about the quote is when Holden saw "Another 'F*** you'" on the wall and says "It was written with a red crayon or something". Crayons are usually associated with children because they are most prominently used by children in various arts, crafts, and coloring activities. Since the F*** you sign was written with a crayon, this suggests that a child wrote it. Again, this contradicts Holden's view that children are always innocent and adults are the vulgar ones, because in this case the child is being vulgar and is corrupted by having knowledge of the profanity. </p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Both these quotes also show that the F*** you signs suggest the idea that growing up is inevitable. Children (even elementary school aged) ones are writing these F*** you signs. This means they have been exposed to vulgar language and have been "corrupted" in Holden's view. If there are young kids being corrupted and losing their innocence, it suggests that growing up, losing innocence, and being exposed to the corruption of the adult world is inevitable, and it can happen even at very young ages. Holden clearly doesn't understand that it's inevitable because he wants to protect children for adulthood and be "the catcher in the rye" as explained on <a href="../../content/main/bildungsroman.html"> the Bildungsroman page.</a></p>
