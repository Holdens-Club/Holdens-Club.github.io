            <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">In the book, Holden mentions that he had a younger brother named Allie who died of leukemia. Holden makes it clear that he liked Allie a lot and appreciated him. For example, in chapter 5, he says...</p>

            <p class="light" style="font-size:14px;text-indent:25px">"My brother Allie...He's dead now. He got leukemia and died when we were up in Maine, on July 18,
            1946. You'd have liked him. He was two years younger than I was, but he was about fifty
            times as intelligent. He was terrifically intelligent. His teachers were always writing
            letters to my mother, telling her what a pleasure it was having a boy like Allie in their
            class. And they weren't just shooting the crap. They really meant it. But it wasn't just that
            he was the most intelligent member in the family. He was also the nicest, in lots of ways.
            He never got mad at anybody...God, he was a nice kid, though. He used to laugh so hard at something he
            thought of at the dinner table that he just about fell off his chair..." (Salinger 38)</p>

            <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Here, Holden clearly shows his admiration for Allie. He says "...he was about fifty times intelligent. He was terrifically intelligent" to show that he admired Allie for being very smart. He says "He was also the nicest...He never got mad at anybody" to show that he admired Allie for being calm and getting along with everyone. Lastly, he also says "God, he was a nice kid, though. He used to laugh so hard...he just about fell off his chair" to show that he admired Allie for his strong sense of humor. </p>

                 <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Considering how much Holden liked Allie, it follows that Allie's death affected Holden very negatively. Allie's death is arguably one of the biggest causes of Holden's depressed state throughout the novel and his breakdown. </p>

                 <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">This page will show Holden's exhibition of the five stages of grief: Denial, Anger, Bargaining/Wishing, Depression, and Avoidance/Acceptance. See the image on the top right for a quick illustration of these stages.</p>

            </div>

          </div>

          <div class="row">
            <div class="col s12 m12">
                <h3>Denial</h3>
                <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Denial is when someone refuses to accept that the person died. Holden shows his denial by doing this like talking to Allie in present tense.</p>

                <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Here's one example from the start of chapter 14...</p>

                <p class="light" style="font-size:14px;text-indent:25px">"What I did, I started talking, sort of out loud, to Allie. I do that sometimes when I get very depressed. I keep telling him to go home and get his bike and meet me in front of Bobby Fallon's house…" (Salinger 98)</p>

                <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Here, Holden says he was talking out loud directly to Allie, as if he was still alive. But since Allie is dead, this shows Holden's denial. He cannot accept the fact that Allie died, and still wants to talk to him.</p>

                <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Here's another example showing Holden's denial from chapter 20, where he was talking about Allie's funeral and how he stopped visiting Allie's grave regularly...</p>

                <p class="light" style="font-size:14px;text-indent:25px">"In the first place, I certainly don't enjoy seeing him in that crazy cemetery. Surrounded by dead guys and tombstones and all…" (Salinger 155)</p>

                <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">In this quote, Holden says "I certainly don't enjoy seeing him in that crazy cemetery. Surrounded by dead guys and tombstones and all..". When he says he doesn't like seeing Allie surrounded by dead people and tombstones, he implies that Allie is not one of the dead guys himself. He also refers to Allie as "him" instead of "his body" or something similiar, which again implies that Allie is still alive. This shows his refusal to accept Allie's death.</p>

                <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Here's another example showing Holden's denial from chapter 25, where he was walking on a street and planning to hitchhike out West...</p>

                <p class="light" style="font-size:14px;text-indent:25px">"Then I started doing something else. Every time I'd get to the end of a block I'd make believe I was talking to my brother Allie. I'd say to him, "Allie, don't let me disappear. Allie, don't let me disappear. Allie, don't let me disappear. Please, Allie." And then when I'd reach the other side of the street without disappearing, I'd thank him" (Salinger 198)</p>

                <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">In this quote, Holden says "I'd make believe I was talking to my brother Allie", and begs Allie to not let him disappear. This is another quote showing Holden talking to Allie in present tense as if he was still alive, meaning he's again denying Allie's death and still wants to talk to him.</p>

          </div>

          <div class="row">
            <div class="col s12 m12">
                <h3>Anger</h3>
                <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Anger is when someone gets angry about the death of a person. They might get angry at the person for leaving them, they might get angry at the person who killed them if they were murdered, they might get angry at god for letting them be killed if they believe in god(s), or they might be angry because they can't understand why it happened.</p>

                <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Here's an example of Holden showing his anger about Allie's death from chapter 5, at the part where Holden talks about how Allie died...</p>

                <p class="light" style="font-size:14px;text-indent:25px">"I was only thirteen, and they were going to have me psychoanalyzed and all, because I broke all the windows in the garage. I don't blame them. I really don't. I slept in the garage the night he died, and I broke all the goddam windows with my fist, just for the hell of it. I even tried to break all the windows on the station wagon we had that summer…" (Salinger 39)</p>

                <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Here, Holden says "I broke all the windows in the garage" and "I broke all the goddam windows with my fist". This is a clear sign of him taking out his anger about Allie's death on the windows by breaking them with just his fist. He also mentions that he "even tried to break all the windows on the station wagon we had that summer", meaning his desire to take out his anger was very strong. He also claims he did this "just for the hell of it" because he doesn't realize or doesn't want to admit to the fact that it was Allie's death caused this anger.</p>

          </div>

          <div class="row">
            <div class="col s12 m12">
                <h3>Bargaining/Wishing</h3>
                <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Bargaining/Wishing is when someone bargains for the person to be brought back to life, as in "If they can come back, I'll do _____". It could also mean wishing they treated the person who died differently. Holden doesn't really bargain to bring Allie back to life in the book, but he has some regrets about how he treated Allie and his funeral.</p>

                <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Here's one example from the start of chapter 14 right after Sunny left his hotel room. Holden reflects on not letting Allie come with him and Bobby Fallon on a BB gun trip to a lake...</p>

                <p class="light" style="font-size:14px;text-indent:25px">"Anyway, Allie heard us talking about it, and he wanted to go, and I wouldn't let him. I told him he was a child. So once in a while, now, when I get very depressed, I keep saying to him, ‘Okay. Go home and get your bike and meet me in front of Bobby's house. Hurry up.’" (Salinger 99)</p>

                <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Here, Holden clearly regrets not letting Allie come with them on the trip. He says, "...I wouldn't let him" and then wishes he had said "Okay. Go home and get your bike...". This shows that Holden wishes he had treated Allie differently, because he is wishing that he had let Allie come with them. .</p>



                <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Here's another example showing Holden "wishing" from chapter 20, where he was talking about how Allie's body was stuck there, having to face rain, decay, etc, while the people visiting him could just pop out their umbrellas or go back to their cars.</p>

                <p class="light" style="font-size:14px;text-indent:25px">"I know it's only his body and all that's in the cemetery, and his soul's in Heaven and all that crap, but I couldn't stand it anyway. I just wish he wasn't there. You didn't know him. If you'd known him, you'd know what I mean" (Salinger 156)</p>

                <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">In this quote, Holden says "I just wish he wasn't there". He explicitly says he wishes Allie's body wasn't there at the cemetery. Holden doesn't like how Allie's body is stuck there to rot and face the weather. He also implies that he would rather have Allie alive than have him dead at the cemetery.</p>



                <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Here's another example showing Holden "wishing"/regret from the same part of the story as the last quote, where Holden reflects on Allie's funeral...</p>

                <p class="light" style="font-size:14px;text-indent:25px">They all came when Allie died, the whole goddam stupid bunch of them. I have this one stupid aunt with halitosis that kept saying how peaceful he looked lying there, D.B. told me. I wasn't there. I was still in the hospital. I had to go to the hospital and all after I hurt my hand." (Salinger 155)</p>

                <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">In this quote, Holden says "I wasn't there. I was still in the hospital. I had to go to the hospital and all after I hurt my hand". Here he is regretting that he wasn't at Allie's funeral since he was in the hospital, and probably wishes he had gone as a way to say goodbye to Allie and get closure.</p>
            </div>

          </div>

           <div class="row">
            <div class="col s12 m12">
                <h3>Depression</h3>
                <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Depression is when someone lets out their feelings of sadness about the person's death, and misses them badly. Holden is depressed throughout this book and explicitly states that he is depressed countless times, but here are just a few examples where he is depressed without prior context. By examples without prior context, we mean examples where Holden is depressed for seemingly no reason, meaning Allie's death caused him to be sad in that situation. There are quotes in the book where Holden says he is depressed WITH a cause in the prior context, such as being depressed because he sees people excited to go to the movies.</p>

                <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">The quotes basically speak for themselves since they are just examples of Holden explicitly stating his depression.</p>

                <p class="light" style="font-size:14px;text-indent:25px">"They gave me this very crumby room, with nothing to look out of the window at except the other side of the hotel. I didn't care much. I was too depressed to care whether I had a good view or not" (Salinger 81)</p>

                <p class="light" style="font-size:14px;text-indent:25px">"Only, I didn't eat the doughnuts. I couldn't swallow them too well. The thing is, if you get very depressed about something, it's hard as hell to swallow" (Salinger 196)</p>

                <p class="light" style="font-size:14px;text-indent:25px">"I still had that headache. It was even worse. And I think I was more depressed than I ever was in my whole life." (Salinger 194)</p>

                <p class="light" style="font-size:14px;text-indent:25px">"When I finally got down off the radiator and went out to the hat-check room, I was crying and all. I don't know why, but I was. I guess it was because I was feeling so damn depressed and lonesome" (Salinger 153)</p>

                
            </div>

          </div>

          <div class="row">
            <div class="col s12 m12">
                <h3>Acceptance/Avoidance</h3>
                <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Acceptance/Avoidance is when a person either accepts the person's death and moves on, able to live normally again, or they avoid thinking about the death and never really come to terms with it. Holden shows both acceptance and avoidance towards Allie's death.</p>

                <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Here's an example of Holden showing his ACCEPTANCE towards Allie's death from chapter 22, where Holden is talking to Phoebe in her room and Phoebe challenges Holden to name one things he likes. Holden responds by saying he likes Allie...</p>

                <p class="light" style="font-size:14px;text-indent:25px">"'Allie's dead--You always say that! If somebody's dead and everything, and in Heaven, then it isn't really--’ ‘I know he's dead! Don't you think I know that? I can still like him, though, can't I? Just because somebody's dead, you don't just stop liking them, for God's sake-- especially if they were about a thousand times nicer than the people you know that're alive and all.'" (Salinger 171)</p>

                <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Here, Holden says "I know he's dead!" and "...Just because somebody's dead" to clearly show that he is aware that Allie is dead, and can still like him while accepting the fact that he is dead at the same time. He also says "Don't you think I know that?" as if it's obvious that Allie died and he accepts it.</p>


                <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Here's an example of Holden showing his AVOIDANCE towards Allie's death from chapter 20, where Holden is talking about how he used to visit Allie's grave with his parents regularly but stopped doing it...</p>

                <p class="light" style="font-size:14px;text-indent:25px">"I went with them a couple of times, but I cut it out. In the first place, I certainly don't enjoy seeing him in that crazy cemetery. Surrounded by dead guys and tombstones and all. It wasn't too bad when the sun was out, but twice--twice-- we were there when it started to rain. It was awful. It rained on his lousy tombstone, and it rained on the grass on his stomach. It rained all over the place. All the visitors that were visiting the cemetery started running like hell over to their cars. That's what nearly drove me crazy. All the visitors could get in their cars and turn on their radios and all and then go someplace nice for dinner--everybody except Allie. I couldn't stand it. I know it's only his body and all that's in the cemetery, and his soul's in Heaven and all that crap, but I couldn't stand it anyway."" (Salinger 155-156)</p>

                <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">In this quote, Holden first says "I went with them a couple of times, but I cut it out". He stopped seeing the grave because he was trying to avoid thinking about Allie's death- visiting the grave would definitely remind him of the death. He also says "I couldn't stand it" twice in this quote to show his desire to avoid thinking about Allie's death and his burial in the cemetery.</p>
