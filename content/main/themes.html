				<h3>Growing up is inevitable</h3>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">One of the big themes in this book is that growing up is inevitable. This is discussed more in the <a href="../../content/main/bildungsroman.html">Bildungsroman page</a>, but Holden is resistant to growing up. He also wants to protect children from losing their innocence and growing into adulthood, thinking that adulthood corrupts people and makes them artificial. This book, however, sends the message that growing up is inevitable. Holden even realizes this eventually. </p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Here's one quote that shows that growing up is inevitable. It's at the part where Holden is talking to Phoebe at their house, and Phoebe calls Holden out on not liking anything that's happening to him:</p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:14px;text-indent:25px;line-height:80%">
          "Old Phoebe said something then, but I couldn't hear her. She had the side of her
          mouth right smack on the pillow, and I couldn't hear her.
          <br><br>
           'What?' I said. 'Take your mouth away. I can't hear you with your mouth that
          way.'
          <br><br>
           'You don't like anything that's happening.'
           <br><br>
           It made me even more depressed when she said that.
           <br><br>
           'Yes I do. Yes I do. Sure I do. Don't say that. Why the hell do you say that?'
           <br><br>
           'Because you don't. You don't like any schools. You don't like a million things.
          You don't.'" (Salinger 169)

        </p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Before this quote, Holden was endlessly griping about how much he hated schools and the phony people in them. Now, in this quote, Phoebe says "You don't like anything that's happening". Although she could just be referring to Holden being negative about everything, she does say that he doesn't like anything that's "happening". "Happening" could refer to the changes Holden is experiencing while growing up- having to go to different schools, having to deal with his peers he doesn't like, having to deal with more adults like teachers that he hates due to their artificialness or condescension, etc. She's saying that Holden doesn't like the adolescence and changes happening in his life due to it. Then, when she says "Because you don't. You don't like any schools. You don't like a million things. You don't", she argues that Holden can't keep hating these changes in his life and he needs to accept them. Basically, this means that she's arguing that growing up is inevitable.</p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Considering the fact that Phoebe is only 10 years old, the idea that she is showing the inevitability of growing up becomes stronger. Even a 10 year old realizes that you have to accept growing up, and can't hate everything about your adolescence. Phoebe has accepted that she has to reach adulthood and is trying to point this out to Holden. Overall, this quote shows that growing up is inevitable and must be accepted.</p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Towards the end of the book, Holden eventually realizes that growing up is inevitable himself and affirms it. Here's a quote near the end of the book where Phoebe is on the carousel and Holden is happy watching her: </p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:14px;text-indent:25px">"Then the carrousel started, and I watched her go around and
around... All the kids kept trying to grab for the gold ring, and so was old Phoebe, and I was 
sort of afraid she'd fall off the goddam horse, but I didn't say anything or do anything.
The thing with kids is, if they want to grab the gold ring, you have to let them do it, and
not say anything. If they fall off they fall off, but it's bad if you say anything to them." (Salinger 211)</p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Holden says "All the kids kept trying to grab for the gold ring". Many carousels used to have rings on the outsides of the carousel that children riding on the horses could reach and grab, and claim them for prizes and rewards. By children grabbing the hold rings in this quote, Holden probably means children reaching for their adulthood (the rings). He goes on to say "if they want to grab the gold ring, you have to let them do it, and not say anything. If they fall off they fall off, but it's bad if you say anything". Basically, Holden is accepting that growing up is inevitable. He is saying that you have to let children reach for their adulthood and grow up. "falling off" could refer to the problems and breakdowns and stress that comes with growing up, and he says that if those things happen, you should not interfere and let it happen, as it's a normal part of growing up. He's affirming the theme that growing up is inevitable and has finally realized that he shouldn't try to protect kids from adulthood.</p>

        <h3>Money doesn't buy happiness</h3>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Another theme present in <i>The Catcher in the Rye</i> is that money can't buy happiness. Holden offers drinks to people, pays for their checks, and tips them in this book, but it doesn't offer him happiness. Let's look at two examples of this. </p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">The first example is when Holden is in the Lavender Room at his hotel and pays for the drinks for the 3 women he danced with. After they leave because they want to see a show early the next morning, Holden says: </p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:14px;text-indent:25px">"With cigarettes and all, the check came to about thirteen bucks. I think they
        should've at least offered to pay for the drinks they had before I joined them--I
        wouldn't've let them, naturally, but they should've at least offered. I didn't care much,
        though. They were so ignorant, and they had those sad, fancy hats on and all. And that
        business about getting up early to see the first show at Radio City Music Hall depressed
        me. If somebody, some girl in an awful-looking hat, for instance, comes all the way to
        New York--from Seattle, Washington, for God's sake--and ends up getting up early in the
        morning to see the goddam first show at Radio City Music Hall, it makes me so
        depressed I can't stand it." (Salinger 75)</p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">As soon as Holden says "the check came to about thirteen bucks" and "they should've at least offered to pay for the drinks they had before I joined them", it's evident that Holden is paying for the drinks the women had. But then he says "They were so ignorant, and they had those sad, fancy hats on and all...that business about getting up early to see the first show at Radio City Music Hall depressed me". The women depressed him because they kept looking around for movie stars, were ignorant, and he doesn't like how they were eager to see a phony show at the Radio City Music Hall. Holden sat and danced with the women because he was desperate for people to talk to and stop being lonely. He thought that paying for their check would make him feel like a generous person (like a gentleman), making him feel happy because of it. He also thought that by paying for their check he could somehow gain the womens' respect or companionship and feel less lonely, but this doesn't make sense. Using his money didn't gain him any happiness because the women depressed him anyway with their ignorance and phoniness. Money didn't buy him happiness in this situation.</p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Another example is while Holden is eating breakfast with the nuns. He gives them a $10 donation and feels sad about it in the end:</p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:14px;text-indent:25px">
          "They let me give them ten bucks as a contribution. They kept asking me if I was
          sure I could afford it and all. I told them I had quite a bit of money with me, but they
          didn't seem to believe me. They took it, though, finally... After they left, I started getting sorry that I'd only given them ten bucks for their
          collection. But the thing was, I'd made that date to go to a matinee with old Sally Hayes,
          and I needed to keep some dough for the tickets and stuff. I was sorry anyway, though.
          Goddam money. It always ends up making you blue as hell." (Salinger 110 & 113)</p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">In this quote, Holden gives them "ten bucks as a contribution". He probably again thought that giving them money would make him feel generous and happy. But then he says "After they left, I started getting sorry that I'd only given them ten bucks for their collection". He got sad because he wishes he gave them more money. In this case, giving the nuns money didn't make him feel happy. It just made him regret giving them so little and he ended up depressed because of it. This is an example of money not buying happiness. Holden even admits to this when he says "Goddam money. It always ends up making you blue as hell". In this part of the quote, Holden explicitly states that money makes people sad in the end and doesn't buy happiness.</p>

        <h3>Life's only good for the privileged</h3>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px"><i>The Catcher in the Rye</i> also has more minor themes scattered in it. One weaker, minor theme in the book that is part of Salinger's criticism on society is that life is only good for the well-off people. By "well-off" people, we mean the popular people, hot-shots, and generally privileged people. Near the beginning of the book, Holden visits his history teacher, Mr. Spencer, at his teacher's house. Because Holden was kicked out and he failed almost all his classes including history, Mr. Spencer asks if Holden is concerned about his future or not. He also tells Holden that life is a game. The idea that life is a game suggests that people are the players and make many choices, decisions, and plans throughout their life, like the players of a game. They have to follow the game's rules, which are rules like laws and social contracts/expectations. They also interact with other players (other people). But here's what Holden had to say about this idea: </p>
       
       <p class="light" style="font-size:14px;text-indent:25px">"'Life is a game, boy. Life is a game that one plays according to the rules.'
         'Yes, sir. I know it is. I know it.'
         Game, my ass. Some game. If you get on the side where all the hot-shots are, then
        it's a game, all right--I'll admit that. But if you get on the other side, where there aren't
        any hot-shots, then what's a game about it? Nothing. No game." (Salinger 8)</p>

       <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Here, Holden says "Game, my ass. Some game". Right off the bat, he shows his strong disapproval and objection to the idea that life is a game. He says "If you get on the side where all the hot-shots are, then it's a game, all right--I'll admit that. But if you get on the other side, where there aren't any hot-shots, then what's a game about it? Nothing. No game". When he says "if you <b>get</b> on the side" or "if you <b>get</b> on the other side", he is implying that everyone ends up on the side of hot-shots (popular, well off people) or the opposite, and that it's out of their control.</p>
       <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">He implies that it's by chance because he uses the word "get". In this part of the quote he says that life is only a game for the popular people, and it's not for the worse-off, unpopular people. This means the unpopular people don't have choices in their life, fun and entertainment from living it (from playing the game), and they don't get to live out a successful life. So, this quote and theme is basically about life being unfair for one side and luxurious for the other. This is an important message J.D. Salinger tried to send in the book and is a part of the social critique of <i>The Catcher in the Rye</i>.
