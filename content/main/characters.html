				<h3>Holden Caulfield</h3>
				
        <h5>Basic Info</h5>
		    <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Holden is the protagonist and narrator of <i>The Catcher in the Rye</i>. He is 17 years old, but the story he is narrating took place around the time of the previous Christmas. He is narrating from some kind of mental institution where he has a psychoanalyst, and mentions that he had a breakdown of some sort that caused this. </p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Holden has a 10-year old sister named Phoebe and an older brother whom he calls "D.B.". He has a father and mother as well. Holden used to have a younger brother called Allie, but he died of leukemia.</p>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col s12 m12">

        <br>
        <h5>Hatred against "phonies"</h5>
        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">One of the biggest things about Holden is his hatred against "phony" people and behaviors. Phony means artificial or fake, so describing someone as phony means they act one way but are actually another way. Holden's hatred towards phoniness means he values people being true to themselves and values strong identity instead of conformity. Here is one example of Holden describing his contempt towards phony people: </p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:14px;text-indent:25px">
          "One of the biggest reasons I left Elkton Hills was because I was
          surrounded by phonies. That's all. They were coming in the goddam window. For
          instance, they had this headmaster, Mr. Haas, that was the phoniest bastard I ever met in
          my life... On Sundays, for instance, old Haas went
          around shaking hands with everybody's parents when they drove up to school. He'd be
          charming as hell and all... if a boy's mother was
          sort of fat or corny-looking or something, and if somebody's father was one of those guys
          that wear those suits with very big shoulders and corny black-and-white shoes, then old
          Hans would just shake hands with them and give them a phony smile and then he'd go
          talk, for maybe a half an hour, with somebody else's parents." (Salinger 13-14)
        </p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">In this quote Holden describes his contempt for the Elkton Hills headmaster's "phoniness" for meeting enthusiastically with the parents, being charming, etc. when Holden believes that life at Elkton Hills was actually depressing.</p>

        <br>
        <h5>Criticizing nature</h5>
        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Holden often criticizes and insults other people in the book, but rarely himself. It shows that he is arrogant and immature. He's arrogant because he feels everyone else is doing something wrong and deserves to be criticized, but he is a good person and doesn't have faults like everyone else. His criticizing nature also reveals Holden's immaturity as being intolerant of others the way Holden is is immature. Here is an example of Holden criticizing someone in the book: </p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:14px;text-indent:25px">
          "Then I tried to get them in a little
          intelligent conversation, but it was practically impossible. You had to twist their arms.
          You could hardly tell which was the stupidest of the three of them. And the whole three
          of them kept looking all around the goddam room, like as if they expected a flock of
          goddam movie stars to come in any minute.  (Salinger 73)        
        </p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">In this quote, Holden is criticizing the 3 women he danced with in his hotel's Lavender Room for being stupid, ignorant, and constantly looking for movie stars in the room.</p>

        <br>
        <h5>Hypocrisy and contradictory nature</h5>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Holden is sometimes hypocritical. He goes back on his beliefs or contradicts himself, and rarely admits it. For example, Holden hates movies but goes to one willingly. Here is where he states that he is against movies: </p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:14px;text-indent:25px">
        "If there's one thing I hate, it's the movies. Don't even
        mention them to me." (Salinger 2)
        </p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">And here is a quote where Holden goes to the movies willingly: </p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:14px;text-indent:25px">
          "I had quite a bit of time to kill till ten o'clock, so what I did, I went to the movies
            at Radio City. It was probably the worst thing I could've done, but it was near, and I
            couldn't think of anything else." (Salinger 137)
        </p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">In this quote, Holden at least admits to the contradiction ("It was probably the worst thing I could've done") and provides an explanation ("but it was near, and I couldn't think of anything else"). However, based on how passionately he claims to hate the movies, this does show his hypocrisy and contradictory nature.</p>

        <br>
        <h5>Cynical</h5>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Another major character trait of Holden is that he is very cynical. For example, when Stradlater asks Holden to write a composition for him, this is what Holden says in his narration: </p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:14px;text-indent:25px">
          'Hey,' Stradlater said. 'Wanna do me a big favor?'
           'What?' I said. Not too enthusiastic. He was always asking you to do him a big
          favor. You take a very handsome guy, or a guy that thinks he's a real hot-shot, and they're
          always asking you to do them a big favor. Just because they're crazy about themself, they
          think you're crazy about them, too, and that you're just dying to do them a favor. It's sort
          of funny, in a way." (Salinger 27-28)
        </p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">In this quote, Holden is making assumptions about Stradlater and claiming that he and other "hot-shots" think everyone else cares about them and is dying to do a favor for them. He also says "Not too enthusiastic" and is taking a sarcastic, negative attitude towards Stradlater, showing cynicism.</p>

        <h3>Phoebe Caulfield</h3>
        
        <h5>Basic Info</h5>
        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Phoebe is Holden's younger 10-year old sister.</p>
        
        <br>
        <h5>One of the few people that understands and is respected by Holden</h5>
        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Holden seems to hate and criticize almost any other person in the book, but one of the people he actually respects is Phoebe. Phoebe also is one of the only few that seems to understand him and listen to him. Here is a quote highlighting this: </p>

        
     </div>

     <div class="col s12 m5">
             <div class="card red darken-3">
            <div class="card-image">
              <div class="video-container">
                <img  src="../../img/phoebe.jpg";/>
              </div>
             
            </div>
            <div class="card-content">
              <p class="white-text">A depiction of Phoebe.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
      </div>

    </div>



    <div class="row">
      <div class="col s12 m12">
        <p class="light" style="font-size:14px;text-indent:25px">
"You'd like her. I mean if you tell old Phoebe
something, she knows exactly what the hell you're talking about. I mean you can even
take her anywhere with you. If you take her to a lousy movie, for instance, she knows it's
a lousy movie. If you take her to a pretty good movie, she knows it's a pretty good movie." (Salinger 67)
        </p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">In this quote, Holden says that Phoebe "knows exactly what the hell you're talking about", meaning she can understand Holden and what he tells her. By saying this, Holden seems to show that he confides in Phoebe as someone to talk to about his feelings and frustrations. Holden clearly respects Phoebe's ability to understand him based on this quote.</p>

        <br>
        <h5>Holden's symbol of innocence and non-corruption</h5>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Holden values Phoebe for her innocence and for not being corrupted by society, which are traits he greatly values as he is against phony people. Here is a quote showing this value for Phoebe: </p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:14px;text-indent:25px;line-height:80%">"She
        has about five thousand notebooks. You never saw a kid with so many notebooks. I
        opened the one on top and looked at the first page. It had on it:
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
         Bernice meet me at recess I have something
         very very important to tell you.
         <br></br>
         <br></br>
         That was all there was on that page. The next one had on it:
         <br></br>
         <br></br>
         Why has south eastern Alaska so many caning factories?
         <br></br>
         Because theres so much salmon
         <br></br>
         Why has it valuable forests?
         <br></br>
         because it has the right climate.
         <br></br>
         What has our government done to make
         <br></br>
         life easier for the alaskan eskimos?

         <br></br>
         Phoebe Weatherfield Caulfield, Esq.
         <br></br>
         Please pass to Shirley!!!!
         <br></br>
         Shirley you said you were sagitarius
         <br></br>
         but your only taurus bring your skates
         <br></br>
         when you come over to my house
         <br></br>
         <br></br>
         I sat there on D.B.'s desk and read the whole notebook. It didn't take me long, and
        I can read that kind of stuff, some kid's notebook, Phoebe's or anybody's, all day and all night 
        <br></br>
        long. Kid's notebooks kill me." (Salinger 160-161)</p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">In this quote, Holden was reading one of Phoebe's notebooks. In the notebook, Phoebe wrote random reminders and thoughts she had. There are grammatical errors and triple exclamation marks (!!!) that make this very informal and non-serious. She has written her direct thoughts without any artificial language, and she is being true to herself. Holden shows his respect for her non-corruption when he says "I can read that kind of stuff, some kid's notebook, Phoebe's or anybody's, all day and all night long. Kid's notebooks kill me". Holden is valuing her non-corrupt and innocent writings.</p>

        <br>
        <h5>More mature than Holden (character foil)</h5>
        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Phoebe demonstrates that she is more mature than Holden and serves as a character foil of him. She realizes the importance of growing up and is not opposed to it like Holden. She also recognizes Holden's overly negative attitude towards almost everything and calls him out on it. Phoebe seems to know that Holden is his own worst enemy. Here is the relevant quote where they are talking after Holden sneaked back into their house: </p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:14px;text-indent:25px">
        “‘You don't like anything that's happening.’ It made me even more depressed when she said that. ‘Yes I do. Yes I do. Sure I do. Don't say that. Why the hell do you say that?’ ‘Because you don't. You don't like any schools. You don't like a million things. You don't.’” (Salinger 169)
        </p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Right before this quote, Holden was complaining about his schools. Now, Phoebe is calling him out for not liking anything and being overly negative. She realizes that Holden needs to grow up in his way of thinking and is overall showing that she's more mature than Holden.</p>

        <h3>Allie Caulfield</h3>
        
        <h5>Basic Info</h5>
        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Allie was Holden's younger brother, but he died of leukemia when he was 11. </p>
       
        <br>
        <h5>Intelligent, nice, got along with everyone</h5>
        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Holden says he respected Allie for being very smart and nice. Allie also didn't get mad at anybody, meaning he got along with other people and the rest of his family. Here's a quote where Holden talks about Allie like this: </p>

          “You'd have liked him He was two years younger than I was, but he was about fifty times as intelligent. He was terrifically intelligent. His teachers were always writing letters to my mother, telling her what a pleasure it was having a boy like Allie in their class. And they weren't just shooting the crap. They really meant it. But it wasn't just that he was the most intelligent member in the family. He was also the nicest, in lots of ways. He never got mad at anybody.” (Salinger 38)
        </p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">In this quote, Holden notes that Allie is about "fifty times as intelligent" as he is, was the nicest member of his family, and never got mad at anybody. He shows great respect and fondness for these characteristics of Allie, and shows that he had a strong emotional attachment to Allie.</p>

        <br>
        <h5>His death was the cause of Holden's downfall</h5>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Because Holden had such a strong emotional attachment to Allie and had great respect for him, it can be inferred that Allie's death caused Holden's depression and eventual downfall into a breakdown in this book. Here is a quote showing Holden's anger and depression about Allie's death: </p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:14px;text-indent:25px">
        “I was only thirteen, and they were going to have me psychoanalyzed and all, because I broke all the windows in the garage. I don't blame them. I really don't. I slept in the garage the night he died, and I broke all the goddam windows with my fist, just for the hell of it. I even tried to break all the windows on the station wagon we had that summer…” (Salinger 39).
      </p>

      <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">In this quote Holden talks about how he slept in the garage the night Allie died and broke many windows with his bare fist. He also tried to break the windows on their car. It shows how angry Allie's death made Holden and the extent to which the death affected Holden negatively. His depression and grief from Allie's death is present throughout the book, and you can read more about how he handles his grief on the <a href="../../content/main/grief.html">Coping With Grief/Loss page</a>. </p>

        <h3>Jane Gallagher</h3>
        
        <h5>Basic Info</h5>
        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Jane is a girl who Holden spent a lot of time with during the summer since their summer homes were next to each other. Jane is Holden's ideal because she is attractive and has a good, non-phony personality at the same time. Holden is very protective and obsessive about Jane.</p>
       
        <br>
        <h5>Cared a lot by Holden</h5>
        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Holden makes it clear that he cares a lot about Jane. For example, here's a quote from when Stradlater was going on a date with Jane: </p>

           “I kept thinking about Jane, and about Stradlater having a date with her and all. It made me so nervous I nearly went crazy. I already told you what a sexy bastard Stradlater was.” (Salinger 34). 
        </p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">In this quote, Holden is worried that Stradlater will try to have sex with Jane. He says "It made me so nervous I nearly went crazy" to indicate that he's worried about Jane (protective) and cares about her a lot. </p>

        <br>
        <h5>Very close to Holden</h5>
        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Holden talks very fondly about Jane and how he enjoyed spending time with her a lot. He also talks about how they had a close relationship. For example: </p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:14px;text-indent:25px">
        “You never even worried, with Jane, whether your hand was sweaty or not. All you knew was, you were happy. You really were. One other thing I just thought of. One time, in this movie, Jane did something that just about knocked me out. The newsreel was on or something, and all of a sudden I felt this hand on the back of my neck, and it was Jane's. It was a funny thing to do. “ (Salinger 79)
        </p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Here, Holden describes how he was always happy with Jane. He starts describing a moment in a movie where Jane put her hand around the back of Holden's neck and how that made Holden happy ("knocked me out"). He is showing how they had a close relationship and how he enjoyed her a lot.</p>

        <br>
        <h5>Non-phoniness</h5>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Holden also respects Jane for not being phony. For example, look at what he says in this quote while reflecting fondly on Jane: </p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:14px;text-indent:25px">
        "I held hands with her all
        the time, for instance. That doesn't sound like much, I realize, but she was terrific to hold
        hands with. Most girls if you hold hands with them, their goddam hand dies on you, or
        else they think they have to keep moving their hand all the time, as if they were afraid
        they'd bore you or something. Jane was different. We'd get into a goddam movie or
        something, and right away we'd start holding hands, and we wouldn't quit till the movie
        was over. And without changing the position or making a big deal out of it." (Salinger 79)
        </p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">In this quote, Holden says that most girls don't hold hands properly and do artificial things like moving it as if they're afraid they'd bore him. He says that Jane was natural and didn't make a big deal about it. This might not seem like much, but it means that Jane is not being phony/artificial with Holden the way other girls are and Holden respects her for her non-phoniness.</p>

        <h3>Sally Hayes</h3>
        
        <h5>Basic Info</h5>
        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Sally is the opposite of Jane for Holden. Holden finds Sally extremely phony and despises her behavior, although he does find her attractive. Sally is a girl Holden used to date in New York, and in this book he goes on another date with her.</p>

        <br>
        <h5>A prime example of a phony</h5>
        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">The most important thing about Sally is that Holden makes her out to be a prime example of a phony person. She likes movies, actors, uses extravagant language, and talks to random people nonsensically (according to Holden). Here is a quote where Holden criticizes her for being phony: </p>

        “I knew old Sally, the queen of the phonies, would start drooling all over the place when I told her I had tickets for that, because the Lunts were in it and all. She liked shows that are supposed to be very sophisticated and dry and all, with the Lunts and all. I don't.” (Salinger 116-117)
        </p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">In this quote, Holden calls Sally the "queen of the phonies" and talks about how she would drool to see a show with the Lunts in it (popular actors at the time). He is clearly painting her as a phony and shows contempt for this.</p>
      
        <br>
        <h5>Reveals Holden's desperation</h5>
        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Sally is used to reveal Holden's desperation for companionship. Holden is dating someone he doesn't like and considers a phony, which reveals his desperation to be with someone even if they aren't suited for him. Other than that, here is a quote where Holden reveals his desperation and impulsive desire to be with Sally: </p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:14px;text-indent:25px">
          "Look," I said. "Here's my idea. How would you like to get the hell out of here?
          Here's my idea. I know this guy down in Greenwich Village that we can borrow his car
          for a couple of weeks. He used to go to the same school I did and he still owes me ten
          bucks. What we could do is, tomorrow morning we could drive up to Massachusetts and
          Vermont, and all around there, see. It's beautiful as hell up there, It really is." I was
          getting excited as hell, the more I thought of it, and I sort of reached over and took old
          Sally's goddam hand. What a goddam fool I was. "No kidding," I said. "I have about a
          hundred and eighty bucks in the bank. I can take it out when it opens in the morning, and
          then I could go down and get this guy's car. No kidding. We'll stay in these cabin camps
          and stuff like that till the dough runs out. Then, when the dough runs out, I could get a
          job somewhere and we could live somewhere with a brook and all and, later on, we could
          get married or something. I could chop all our own wood in the wintertime and all.
          Honest to God, we could have a terrific time! Wuddaya say? C'mon! Wuddaya say? Will
          you do it with me? Please!" (Salinger 132)
        </p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">In this quote, Holden describes an absurd fantasy of running away with Sally to a cabin and getting married. At the end he is pleading for her to agree when he says "C'mon! Wuddaya say? Will you do it with me? Please!". This reveals his desperation for companionship because he dreamed a fantasy to be with someone he doesn't even like and is pleading to go through with the impulsive plan.</p>

        <h3>Robert Ackley</h3>
        
        <h5>Basic Info</h5>
        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Ackley is the kid who lives in the room next to Holden's in his Pencey dorm.</p>

        <br>
        <h5>Disgusting/repulsive nature</h5>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Holden describes Ackley as being annoying and disgusting. For example, look at the following quote: </p>
       

     </div>
     <div class="col s12 m5">
             <div class="card red darken-3">

    </div>

         <p class="light" style="font-size:14px;text-indent:25px">
        “The whole time he roomed next to me, I never even once saw him brush his teeth. They always looked mossy and awful, and he damn near made you sick if you saw him in the dining room with his mouth full of mashed potatoes and peas or something. Besides that, he had a lot of pimples. Not just on his forehead or his chin, like most guys, but all over his whole  face. And not only that, he had a terrible personality.” (Salinger 19)
        </p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Here, Holden criticizes Ackley for not brushing his teeth, having lots of pimples, and having a bad personality. He makes out Ackley to be a disgusting, repulsive person in general.</p>

        <br>
        <h5>Non-phony</h5>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">In the previous quote, Holden makes out Ackley to be a disgusting and repulsive person. But this does mean that Ackley is not a phony and that Holden respects him for it. Ackley is portrayed as non-phony because he doesn't care about social expectations and what others think of him, and continues to be himself with his disgusting habits. So, despite Ackley being repulsive, Holden at least appreciates him being true to himself. He's disgusting on the outside but honest on the inside.</p>

        <br>
        <h5>Highlights Holden's ability to be compassionate</h5>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">There is one quote where Ackley is used to show Holden's good, compassionate side. It's when Holden invites Ackley to see a movie with him and Mal:</p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:14px;text-indent:25px">
        “I yelled over and asked old Ackley if he wanted to go to the movies.” (Salinger 36)
        </p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Holden detests Ackley and criticized him for his digusting habits and bad personality. Now that he's inviting Ackley to the movies, Holden is shown to have a good side to him that is compassionate and accepting of the people he doesn't like.</p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Another example of this is the quote when Holden was worried about Stradlater's date with Jane and says this: </p>
        
        <p class="light" style="font-size:14px;text-indent:25px">
        “All of a sudden, Ackley barged back in again, through the damn shower curtains, as usual. For once in my stupid life, I was really glad to see him. He took my mind off the other stuff.” (Salinger 34-35). 
        </p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Again, despite Holden criticizing Ackley and hating his disgusting habits, he admits that he can enjoy Ackley's company when he needs comfort. It shows his ability to be compassionate and accepting of others.</p>

        <h3>Ward Stradlater</h3>
        
        <h5>Basic Info</h5>
        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Stradlater is Holden's roommate at his Pencey. He is a typical athletic student ("jock") who spends time with girls, is handsome, and is popular.</p>

        <br>
        <h5>Sexual experience</h5>
        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Stradlater is the only other person other than Luce who Holden recognizes for his sexual experience. Stradlater's possible sexual advances on Jane also make him worried and drive him crazy because he cares about Jane a lot. Here is a quote where Holden recognizes Stradlater's sexual experience: </p>

        "The thing is, you didn't know Stradlater. I
        knew him. Most guys at Pencey just talked about having sexual intercourse with girls all
        the time--like Ackley, for instance--but old Stradlater really did it. I was personally
        acquainted with at least two girls he gave the time to. That's the truth." (Salinger 48-49)
        </p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">In this quote, Holden talks about how Stradlater actually had sex with girls while most people he knows just claim and talk about it. When he says "I was personally acquainted with at least two girls he gave the time to", it highlights Stradlater's sexual nature. Holden is implying that because Stradlater had sex with two girls Holden knew, he must have done it with many, many more and has a lot of experience.</p>
     
        <br>
        <h5>Highlights Holden's criticizing nature</h5>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Another thing about Stradlater is that he was used to highlight Holden's criticizing nature. Holden criticized him in this quote: </p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:14px;text-indent:25px">a href="
        “Stradlater was more of a secret slob. He always looked all right, Stradlater, but for instance, you should've seen the razor he shaved himself with. It was always rusty as hell and full of lather and hairs and crap. He never cleaned it or anything. He always looked good when he was finished fixing himself up, but he was a secret slob anyway, if you knew him the way I did” (Salinger 27)
        </p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">In this quote, Holden criticized Stradlater for being a secret slob: he looks handsome on the outside but actually has dirty habits in reality. His razor, for example, was dirty with hairs, rust, and lather. Holden is criticizing people like Stradlater that act one way but are really a different way on the inside. This is part of his social criticism in the book which you can read about on the <a href="../../content/main/socialcritique.html">Purpose: Social Critique</a> page.</p>
