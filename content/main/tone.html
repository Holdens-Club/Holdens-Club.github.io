            <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">The tone of a literary work is the author's attitude towards the subject. In this case, since Holden is narrating the book, the tone is Holden's attitude in the book. In this page we will discuss Holden's confessional tone as well as his general tone of superiority, arrogance, and cynicism.</p>
            <br></br><br></br><br></br>
			<h3>Confessional Tone</h3>
			
			
			
			<p class="light" style="font-size:18px">A confessional tone involves a character revealing things they do/the way they are, especially when it's negative. A confessional tone is present in <i>The Catcher in the Rye</i> because Holden makes confessions to the reader.</p>

			<p class="light" style="font-size:18px">For example, let's look at this quote from chapter 5 where Holden talks about his dead brother Allie and how he smashed the windows in the garage the night he died... </p>
			
			<p class="light" style="font-size:14px;text-indent:25px">"I even tried to break all the windows on the station wagon we had that summer, but my hand was already broken and everything by that time, and I couldn't do it. It was a very stupid thing to do, I'll admit..." (Salinger 39)</p>

            <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">In this quote, Holden says he broke the windows in the garage and injured his hand badly. He says "It was a very stupid thing to do, I'll admit", so he confesses to the reader that breaking the windows and his hand wasn't a good idea.</p>
            
			<p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Let's take another example of Holden's confessional tone from when he introduces his red hunting hat and how he swung it around when wearing it...
        
			<p class="light" style="font-size:14px;text-indent:25px">"It was this red hunting hat, with one
			of those very, very long peaks. I saw it in the window of this sports store when we got out
			of the subway, just after I noticed I'd lost all the goddam foils. It only cost me a buck.
			The way I wore it, I swung the old peak way around to the back--very corny, I'll admit,
			but I liked it that way. I looked good in it that way." (Salinger 17-18)"</p>
			
            <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">In this quote, Holden says "The way I wore it, I swung the old peak way around to the back- very corny, I'll admit, but I liked it that way". He explicitly confesses to the reader that the way he wears the hat backwards is corny, showing a confessional tone. In this case, since Holden wears his hat in a strange way that he admits is corny, he is showing his desire to be independent/different from everyone else.</p>
         
			<p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Here's one last example from Holden's date with Sally where Holden comments on Sally being pretty...</p>
			
			
			<p class="light" style="font-size:14px;text-indent:25px">"The funny part is, I felt like marrying
			her the minute I saw her. I'm crazy. I didn't even like her much, and yet all of a sudden I
			felt like I was in love with her and wanted to marry her. I swear to God I'm crazy. I admit
			it." (Salinger 124)</p>
			
			<p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Holden has referred to Sally as the "queen of phonies" before and he even says in this quote that "I didn't even like her much". But he admits to feeling like "marrying her the minute I saw her" and says "I felt like I was in love with her". Holden confesses to this contradiction in the quote as he says "I'm crazy"/"I swear to God I'm crazy". In this case he confesses to a contradiction that would make him seem hypocritical. Holden rarely points out these kinds of faults in his character/thinking so when he does it in quotes like this, it makes him a more likeable character.</p>
		
		    <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">The deeper significance of the confessional tone in the book, as discussed in the previous quote, is that it makes Holden a more likeable/positive character. We've discussed this in the Characters page (<a href="../../content/main/characters.html">click here</a>) and will talk about it in the next tone sections on this page as well, but Holden is generally very negative, cynical, bitter, and arrogant. The idea that he can sometimes confess to these contradictions/shortcomings in his character or actions makes him a little less arrogant and more likeable, and it makes him seem like more of a normal human being.</p>

			<h3>Negativity, Cynicism, Arrogance, Judgemental Attitude</h3>
			
			<p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Holden's tone of negativity, cynicism, arrogance, and a judgemental attitude throughout this book are the fundamental characteristics of Holden. He is constantly negative and cynical throughout this book towards other people and towards society in general. There are too many examples of Holden showing this tone, so let's look at just 2 examples for now.</p>
			
			<p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Here's one quote from when Holden was at Ernie's club. He had just met his older brother's former girlfriend, Lillian Simmons, and decided to leave so he wouldn't have to sit with her:</p>
			
			<p class="light" style="font-size:14px;text-indent:25px">"I couldn't even stick around to hear old Ernie play something halfway decent.
			But I certainly wasn't going to sit down at a table with old Lillian Simmons and that Navy
			guy and be bored to death. So I left. It made me mad, though, when I was getting my
			coat. People are always ruining things for you."</p>
			
			<p class="light" style="font-size:18px">To begin with, he says "I couldn't even stick around to hear old Ernie play something halfway decent", having ran into Lillian. He is blalantly complaining and being negative in this quote. And it's his own fault, because he goes on to say "I certainly wasn't going to sit down at a table with old Lillian Simmons and that Navy guy and be bored to death". He even says "So I left. It made me mad, though, when I was getting my coat. People are always ruining things for you" It's his own fault for not wanting to converse with them, but he acts as if they ruined it for him, and that it's their fault he has to leave. This kind of thinking is very arrogant and cynical. He's thinking that everyone else is always messing things up for him and he never causes any of his own problems.</p>
			
			
			<p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Here's one quote from when Holden dropped and broke the Little Shirley Beans record and his hair was frozen with chunks of ice:</p>
			
			<p class="light" style="font-size:14px:text-indent:25px">"I thought probably I'd get
			pneumonia and die. I started picturing millions of jerks coming to my funeral and all. My
			grandfather from Detroit, that keeps calling out the numbers of the streets when you ride
			on a goddam bus with him, and my aunts--I have about fifty aunts--and all my lousy
			cousins. What a mob'd be there. They all came when Allie died, the whole goddam stupid
			bunch of them. I have this one stupid aunt with halitosis that kept saying how peaceful he
			looked lying there, D.B. told me." (Salinger 154-155).
			</div>
			
			<p class="light" style="font-size:18px">This quote is an example of Holden's judgemental and cynical tone. He judges his relatives by calling them "milions of jerks" and judges them on their behavior. For example, he asserts that his grandfather is a jerk because he "keeps calling out the numbers of the streets when you rideon a goddam bus with him". He insults one of his aunts by reffering to her as "this one stupid aunt with halitosis". Holden is judging his own relatives and insulting them in a very condescending way, showing his negative, cynical, and judgemental tone in the book.</p>
		
			<p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Overall, since Holden is narrating the book, the main purpose of his negative, cynical, arrogant, and judgemental tone is to describe what he's like as a character. These kinds of character traits portray Holden as an angsty teenager, and make him a more unlikeable character. However, he can be likeable at times such as in his confessional tone (discussed above). The negative side of his character and tone is much more strongly present, though.</p>
