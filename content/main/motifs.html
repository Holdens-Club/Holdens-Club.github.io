				<h3>Holden's Red Hunting Hat</h3>
				
			  <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">In chapter 3, Holden mentions that he bought a red hunting hat in New York for $1. Throughout the book, he wears it, takes it off, and talks about it in many different scenarios. So what's the significance of the hat? Well, we think that the hunting hat is really a representation of Holden's character as a whole. Based on the details of each scenario the hat is brought up in, and what Holden does with it, there are many different things the hat represents over the course of the book, but they all are related to Holden as a character.</p>

        <h5>Holden's Criticizing Nature</h5>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Let's look at one scenario where the hat is brought up in near the beginning of the book. Ackley comes into Holden's Pencey dorm room and interrupts his reading. Holden starts criticizing Ackley's disgusting self, and then the hat is brought up:</p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:14px;text-indent:25px">“...I never even once saw him brush his teeth… Besides that, he had a lot of pimples.... All over his face. And not only that, he had a terrible personality. He was also sort of a nasty guy... ‘Where the hellja get that hat?’ he said… ‘That’s a deer shooting hat’. ‘Like hell it is’. I took it off and looked at it. I sort of closed one eye, like I was taking aim at it. ‘This is a people shooting hat’, I said. ‘I shoot people in this hat’” (Salinger 19 & 22). </p>
      
        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Holden first says "I never even once saw him brush his teeth... Besides that, he had a lot of pimples... All over his face. And not only that, he had a terrible personality. He was also sort of a nasty guy...". In this part of the quote Holden is explicitly criticizing Ackley for not brushing his teeth, looking disgusting, and having a bad personality. This is a showcase of Holden's tendency to criticize almost everyone else negatively. But then Ackley brings up Holden's hunting hat, saying it's a deer shooting hat. Holden says this in response- "This is a people shooting hat... I shoot people in this hat". By "shooting" people in the hat, Holden is referring to criticizing people in the hat. Because Holden was talking negatively about Ackley right before he said he shoots people in the hat, it's clear that he means he criticizes people in the hat.</p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">This means that one thing the hat represents about Holden's character is his critical nature of people, and constant need to insult and tear apart almost any other person. It's part of Holden's cynical and negative personality as discussed <a href="../../content/main/characters.html">on the Characters page.</a></p>

        <br>
        <h5>Holden's Need for Acceptance/Conformity</h5>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Holden might seem like the last person to want to conform or be socially acceptable. He constantly criticizes society, artificial conformists, and generally stays away from other people. But there are a few times where Holden actually takes his hat off because of how strange it looks. He's basically caring about what others think of him and wants to be socially acceptable when he does this. Let's look at one example from when Holden is checking into the Edmont hotel:</p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:14px;text-indent:25px">“We got to the Edmont hotel, and I checked in. I’d put on my red hunting cap when I was in the cab, just for the hell of it, but I took it off before I checked in. I didn’t want to look like a screwball or something. Which is really ironic. I didn’t know then that the goddam hotel was full of perverts and morons. Screwballs all over the place.” (Salinger 61).</p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Holden says "I'd put on my red hunting cap when I was in the cab... but I took it off before I checked in. I didn't want to look like a screwball or something". He explicitly states that he took the hat off in order to not look strange or weird. This means that he's caring about what other people will think of him and wants to be accepted by the other members of society. </p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Since Holden usually hates society and conformity, this also reveals his contradictory nature. He always makes himself look like an independent, rebellious person, but in reality he does sometimes care about being accepted by his peers and other people.</p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Overall, based on this quote, the hunting hat represents Holden's contradictory nature and his need to be accepted by others.</p>
      
        <br>
        <h5>Holden's Grasp on Childhood/Resistance to Growing Up</h5>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Another thing the hunting hat represents is Holden's grasp on his childhood and resistance to growing up. Let's look at a quote that shows this near the end of the book. Holden sneaked into his house and is talking with Phoebe. He is about to leave to go to Mr. Antolini's apartment, but before going he asks for some money and gives Phoebe his hunting hat: </p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:14px;text-indent:25px">“‘Listen. You got any dough, Phoeb? I’m practically broke.’... She put the dough in my hand... Then, all of a sudden, I started to cry. I couldn’t help it… Then I took my hunting hat out of my coat pocket and gave it to her. She likes those kind of crazy hats. She didn't want to take it, but I made her. I'll bet she slept with it on. She really likes those kind of hats.” (Salinger 178-180)
        </p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">In this quote, Holden has to accept some of Phoebe's Christmas money because he's "practically broke". He then says "Then, all of a sudden, I started to cry. I couldn't help it". The reason he is crying is because he realizes how bad his situation is. As a 16 year old he couldn't manage his money properly and wasted it on drinks and cigarettes. Now, he had to stoop so low as to accept Christmas money from his 10 year old sister. He realizes how immature he has been and is saddened by it. Then, Holden says "Then I took my hunting hat out of my coat pocket and gave it to her". Here, Holden gives up his hat to Phoebe. After realizing how immature he has been and how bad his situation has been, giving his hat to Phoebe is a way of giving up on his childhood and realizing he needs to grow up. </p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">This is also supported by the fact that Phoebe's and Allie's hair is red, and so is the hat. Phoebe and Allie are two children that he admires greatly for their innocence. Since the hat is the same color, it means the hat is a symbol of innocence and childhood. Since the hat belongs to Holden, it's Holden's grasp on his childhood and resistance to growing up. Fortunately for him, in this quote when he gives up the hat, he does finally accept that he needs to grow up.</p>

        <h3>Cigarettes</h3>
       
        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Holden smokes a lot of cigarettes throughout the course of the book. We think that the significance of the cigarettes is that they provide comfort when Holden smokes them. This is because he smokes them in situations were he is anxious or depressed. Let's look at two situations here.</p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">One example is from when Stradlater comes back from his date with Jane. Holden also tore up the composition he wrote for Stradlater after Stradlater rejected it, and they are on bad terms in the moment: </p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:14px;text-indent:25px">
        "Then I lay
        down on my bed, and we both didn't say anything for a long time. He got all undressed,
        down to his shorts, and I lay on my bed and lit a cigarette. You weren't allowed to smoke
        in the dorm, but you could do it late at night when everybody was asleep or out and
        nobody could smell the smoke. Besides, I did it to annoy Stradlater. It drove him crazy
        when you broke any rules... He still didn't say one single solitary word about Jane...  'What'd you do?' I said. 'Give her the
time in Ed Banky's goddam car?' My voice was shaking something awful.
 'What a thing to say. Want me to wash your mouth out with soap?'
 'Did you?'
 'That's a professional secret, buddy.'" (Salinger 41-43)
        </p>

        
      </div>

      <div class="col s12 m5">
             <div class="card red darken-3">
            <div class="card-image">
              <div class="video-container">
                <img  src="../../img/cigarettes.jpg";/>
              </div>
             
            </div>
            <div class="card-content">
              <p class="white-text">A pack of cigarettes</p>
            </div>
          </div>

    </div>

     <div class="row">
      <div class="col s12 m12">

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">In this quote, Holden is worried that Stradlater had sex with Jane. He says "He still didn't say one single solitary word about Jane" and "What'd you do?... Give her the time in Ed Banky's goddam car?". He is clearly concerned about Jane and is wondering if Stradlater had sex with her in Ed Banky's car. He also says "My voice was shaking something awful" to further indicate that he is concerned and anxious about it. While he is worried about Jane, he is smoking. Earlier in the quote he said "I lay on my bed and lit a cigarette... Besides, I did it to annoy Stradlater. It drove him crazy when you broke any rules". Holden claims he was smoking because he wanted to annoy Stradlater, but because he clearly shows that he's worried about Jane, he is smoking as a way of coping or calming himself down. The cigarettes are providing comfort for him while he worries about Jane, a person he really cares about and appreciates.</p>


        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Here is another example of Holden using cigarettes for comfort. He is in his hotel room after Sunny left, and thinks about Allie: </p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:14px;text-indent:25px">"After Old Sunny was gone, I sat in the chair for a while and smoked a couple of
        cigarettes... Boy, I felt miserable. I felt so depressed, you
        can't imagine. What I did, I started talking, sort of out loud, to Allie. I do that sometimes
        when I get very depressed. I keep telling him to go home and get his bike and meet me in
        front of Bobby Fallon's house... Anyway, what happened was, one day Bobby and I were going over to Lake
        Sedebego on our bikes. We were going to take our lunches and all, and our BB guns--we
        were kids and all, and we thought we could shoot something with our BB guns. Anyway,
        Allie heard us talking about it, and he wanted to go, and I wouldn't let him. I told him he
        was a child. So once in a while, now, when I get very depressed, I keep saying to him,
        "Okay. Go home and get your bike and meet me in front of Bobby's house. Hurry up." (Salinger 98-99)
        </p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">In this quote, Holden says "I felt miserable" and "I felt so depressed, you can't imagine" to make it clear that he's feeling sad in the moment. He then talks about Allie and how he didn't let Allie come with him and Bobby Fallon on a BB gun trip years ago. He clearly regrets not letting Allie come with them. Then Holden says "So once in a while, now, when I get very depressed, I keep saying to him, 'Okay. Go home and get your bike and meet me in front of Bobby's house. Hurry up'". He is making it clear that he gets sad thinking about Allie, and he imagines himself talking to Allie and letting him come with them out of his regret. At the beginning of the quote Holden says "I sat in the chair for a while and smoked a couple of cigarettes". Again, he is smoking the cigarettes in a situation where he feels regretful, miserable, and depressed, meaning the cigarettes are providing Holden with comfort. They are also helping him cope with his regret and grief of Allie. You can read more about Holden's grief for Allie and how he deals with it on the <a href="../../content/main/grief.html"> Coping With Grief/Loss page</a>.</p>

      <div class="col s12 m12">
        <h3>Blood / Dying</h3>
       
        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Blood and dying is a recurring motif in the book that represents "toughness" or "nobility". This probably doesn't make sense/is very unclear right now, but we'll use 3 examples to explain what we mean by this.</p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">The first example we'll look at is the "Maurice" example. This is when Maurice punches Holden in the stomach after demanding he pays an extra $5 for Sunny's services. After Maurice punches him and leaves, Holden starts imagining this: </p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:14px;text-indent:25px">
        "About halfway to the bathroom, I sort of
        started pretending I had a bullet in my guts. Old 'Maurice had plugged me... I pictured myself coming out of the goddam bathroom,
        dressed and all, with my automatic in my pocket, and staggering around a little bit. Then
        I'd walk downstairs, instead of using the elevator. I'd hold onto the banister and all, with
        this blood trickling out of the side of my mouth a little at a time. What I'd do, I'd walk
        down a few floors--holding onto my guts, blood leaking all over the place-- and then I'd
        ring the elevator bell. As soon as old Maurice opened the doors, he'd see me with the
        automatic in my hand and he'd start screaming at me, in this very high-pitched, yellowbelly
        voice, to leave him alone. But I'd plug him anyway. Six shots right through his fat
        hairy belly. Then I'd throw my automatic down the elevator shaft--after I'd wiped off all
        the finger prints and all. Then I'd crawl back to my room and call up Jane and have her
        come over and bandage up my guts. I pictured her holding a cigarette for me to smoke
        while I was bleeding and all." (Salinger 103-104)
        </p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">In this quote, Holden imagines himself being shot in the guts by Maurice. He imagines killing Maurice with a gun very brutally. Holden is obviously imagining himself being tough in this quote. For example, he says "I'd walk downstairs, instead of using the elevator"- if he actually was shot it would be difficult to walk down the stairs, but Holden's trying to imagine himself toughing it out. He also says "he'd start screaming at me, in this very high-pitched, yellowvelly voice, to leave him alone. But I'd plug him anyway". He is imagining Maurice being terrified after seeing the gun and pleading for his life, and imagines that he'd shoot him anyway. This is him imagining being tough.</p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Tying this into the blood motif, Holden mentions blood in this quote a few times: "with this blood trickling out of the side of my mouth a little at a time", "blood leaking all over the place" and "while I was bleeding and all". He is imagining himself bleeding, and being subject to extreme pain because he was shot, yet still killing Maurice. Him bleeding and being able to withstand it is Holden imagining himself being tough and strong. In reality, Holden admits to being a pacifist and loses fights in this book. The blood and bleeding represents toughness in this quote.</p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Here's another example of blood representing toughness from when Holden was drinking endlessly at the Wicker Bar, right after Luce left: </p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:14px;text-indent:25px">
        "When I was really drunk, I started that
        stupid business with the bullet in my guts again. I was the only guy at the bar with a
        bullet in their guts. I kept putting my hand under my jacket, on my stomach and all, to
        keep the blood from dripping all over the place. I didn't want anybody to know I was
        even wounded. I was concealing the fact that I was a wounded sonuvabitch." (Salinger 150)

        </p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Here, Holden brings up the idea of being shot in the stomach and bleeding again, just like in the last quote with Maurice. The interesting thing this time is he says "I kept putting my hand under my jacket, on my stomach an all, to keep the blood from dripping all over the place. I didn't want anybody to know I was even wounded. I was concealing the fact that I was a wounded sonuvabitch." Holden is basically saying that he's trying to cover up his wound and doesn't want anybody to know he's bleeding. This is him wanting to be tough, because he doesn't want anybody to worry about him and his wound- he can handle it. He's imagining himself being able to tough out the bleeding and pain from being shot. In this scenario, the blood/bleeding makes Holden out to be tough, so blood represents toughness.</p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Finally, let's look at one last example that connects two quotes. This scenario is about a boy named James Castle at Elkton Hills, one of Holden's previous prep schools. Let's first look at the quote where Holden describes James Castle's suicide and story: </p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:14px;text-indent:25px">
        "There was this one boy at Elkton Hills, named James Castle, that wouldn't
        take back something he said about this very conceited boy, Phil Stabile. James Castle
        called him a very conceited guy, and one of Stabile's lousy friends went and squealed on
        him to Stabile. So Stabile, with about six other dirty bastards, went down to James
        Castle's room and went in and locked the goddam door and tried to make him take back
        what he said, but he wouldn't do it. So they started in on him. I won't even tell you what
        they did to him--it's too repulsive--but he still wouldn't take it back, old James Castle.
        And you should've seen him. He was a skinny little weak-looking guy, with wrists about
        as big as pencils. Finally, what he did, instead of taking back what he said, he jumped out
        the window...  He was dead, and his teeth, and blood, were all over the place, 
        and nobody would even go near him" (Salinger 170)
        </p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">In this quote, Holden says that James Castle called out another student, Stabile, on his conceitedness and refused to take back his insult after being harassed by Stabile and his friends. Then James Castle jumped out the window and died instead of taking it back. From this quote it is evident that James Castle suicided out of honor, pride, nobility, and toughness.</p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">The ending part of the quote where Holden says "He was a skinny little weak-looking guy, with wrists about as big as pencils. Finally, what he did, instead of taking back what he said, he jumped out the window" is the part that shows this. James is described as a weak person, and he stands up for himself by refusing to take back the insult. Instead, he jumps out the window. James did this out of pride and righteousness, and didn't go back on what he thought was right- calling out the student for being conceited. James was trying to be some kind of martyr, who died to stand up for himself. As a weak, skinny person, he was trying to show his toughness and strength by jumping. Holden ties the blood motif into this scenario by saying "He was dead, and his teeth, and blood, were all over the place". Holden's description of James' body and his blood relate the suicide back to the blood motif, and this description of his body cements the idea that he was trying to be a martyr of some kind.</p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">If that was unclear, we'll now show James was trying to be tough by relating this to another quote later on in the book. Mr. Antolini is one of Holden's former teachers at Elkton Hills that Holden respected greatly. Holden describes Mr. Antolini as being "about the best teacher I ever had". Mr. Antolini was the one who eventually carried James' body to the hospital, while everyone else didn't come close to his body.</p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">When Holden goes to Mr. Antolini's apartment near the end of the book, Mr. Antolini brings up an argument that you should not try to die nobly for a cause. He seems to be concerned about this because of what James Castle did, someone Mr. Antolini has an investment to after being the one to carry his body away. Here's a quote from Holden and Mr. Antolini's discussion: </p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:14px;text-indent:25px">

        "I don't want to scare you," he said, "but I can very clearly see you dying nobly,
        one way or another, for some highly unworthy cause." He gave me a funny look. "If I
        write something down for you, will you read it carefully? And keep it?"
         "Yes. Sure," I said. I did, too. I still have the paper he gave me.
         He went over to this desk on the other side of the room, and without sitting down
        wrote something on a piece of paper. Then he came back and sat down with the paper in
        his hand. "Oddly enough, this wasn't written by a practicing poet. It was written by a
        psychoanalyst named Wilhelm Stekel. Here's what he--Are you still with me?"
         "Yes, sure I am."
         "Here's what he said: 'The mark of the immature man is that he wants to die nobly
        for a cause, while the mark of the mature man is that he wants to live humbly for one.'" (Salinger 188)
        </p>

        <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">In this quote, Mr. Antolini is concerned Holden is trying to dye nobly for an unworthy cause, and presents the quote: "The mark of the immature man is that he wants to die nobly for a cause, while the mark of the mature man is that he wants to live humbly for one". Mr. Antolini is clearly referring to James Castle dying for the unworthy cause of standing up for himself and his opinion. His experience with James Castle is making him worry that Holden might be trying to do the same thing in this quote. This quote from Mr. Antolini's discussion is proof that James Castle's death was for toughness and righteousness, something Mr. Antolini is concerned about. It contributes to the blood/dying motif representing toughness.</p>
