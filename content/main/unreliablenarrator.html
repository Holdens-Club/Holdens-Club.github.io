            <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Holden is an example of an unreliable narrator. His narration cannot be trusted to be accurate. There are a few examples from the text that make it clear he is not always narrating accurately.</p>

            <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">For example, take this quote from the start of Chapter 3, which comes right after Holden tells Mr. Spencer that he has to get equipment from the gym (as an excuse to leave quickly).</p>

            <p class="light" style="font-size:14px;text-indent:25px">"I'm the most terrific liar you ever saw in your life. It's awful. If I'm on my way to
            the store to buy a magazine, even, and somebody asks me where I'm going, I'm liable to
            say I'm going to the opera. It's terrible. So when I told old Spencer I had to go to the gym
            and get my equipment and stuff, that was a sheer lie. I don't even keep my goddam
            equipment in the gym." (Salinger 16)</p>

            <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">First, he says, "I'm the most terrific liar you ever saw in your life. It's awful." Here, Holden explicitly admits to being a liar and even says "It's awful", as if he admits this is a fault in his character and his habit of lying is bad. He suggests it's bad again when he says "It's terrible". He also gives the example of lying about going to the opera to illustrate how regularly he does it. Considering that Holden has admitted to being a regular liar, who's to say that he isn't lying in/skewing his narration as well?</p>

            <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Let's take another example from his date with Sally when they sit at a table, having failed at ice skating:</p>

            <p class="light" style="font-size:14px;text-indent:25px">"'Well, I hate it. Boy, do I hate it,' I said. 'But it isn't just that. It's everything. I
            hate living in New York and all. Taxicabs, and Madison Avenue buses, with the drivers
            and all always yelling at you to get out at the rear door, and being introduced to phony
            guys that call the Lunts angels, and going up and down in elevators when you just want to
            go outside, and guys fitting your pants all the time at Brooks, and people always--'
            'Don't shout, please,' old Sally said. Which was very funny, because I wasn't
            even shouting.
             'Take cars,' I said. I said it in this very quiet voice... 
             'Why not? Why the hell not?'
             'Stop screaming at me, please,' she said. Which was crap, because I wasn't even screaming at her. " (Salinger 130-132)</p>

            <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">In this quote, Holden was rambling VERY PASSIONATELY about his hatred for phonies and his impulsive idea to run away with Sally to the woods and get married. Holden shows he's an unreliable narrator two times in this passage after Sally's requests to stop shouting and screaming. He says "Which was very funny, because I wasn't even shouting" and "Which was crap, because I wasn't even screaming at her". Based on how passionately Holden was rambling and his established strong hatred for phonies, Holden was almost definitely shouting or at least talking loudly. Furthermore, he says "Why not? Why the hell not?" which is what someone would say when they're worked up and angry, and shouting loudly. Despite this, at these two parts of the passage he claims he wasn't screaming and shouting which shows that he was unaware that he actually was. He shows he is an unreliable narrator in this passage, as he claims he wasn't shouting when he almost definitely was. It also shows he is an unreliable narrator as he was unwilling to consider that he may have been too worked up, having denied Sally's requests twice.</p>

            <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">The fact that Holden is an unreliable narrator means that readers should not take his narration at face value. It is influenced by his character traits such as immaturiy and arrogance, his beliefs, and his opinions. Realizing that Holden is an unreliable narrator is important because it makes the reader look more closely at Holden's actions and thoughts, and this will develop a better understanding of his character traits.</p>

              <p>An unreliable narrator is a narrator that does not speak the truth when narrating. In other words, their narration cannot be trusted completely. This may be due to them lying in the narration, overexaggerating things, or remembering things incorrectly. Also, their own biases and attitudes towards the subject may skew the way they narrate it.</p>
