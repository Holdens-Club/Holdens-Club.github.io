            <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">One of the purposes J.D. Salinger had for writing this book was to make a social criticism. Holden constantly criticizes society and societal norms in this book, often using the word "phony" to describe people as conformists/artificial. The 1950s was arguably a period of conformity and less individualism, and J.D. Salinger probably used Holden's constant critiquing to deliver his own views of the 1950s American society with the reader.</p>

            <div class="card-content white-text">
              <span class="card-title" style="font-weight:bold">Social critique</span>
              <p>Social critique is the criticism of/opposition to society and/or its people. The criticism can be directed towards things like the way the society operates, social expectations/standards, the actions of the members of society, or common beliefs/interests of its members.</p>

		  <div class="row">
			<div class="col s12 m12">
			  <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">There are too many examples of Holden critiquing society in the book, but let's just look at two for now.</p>

				<p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Here is one example from when Holden is on Broadway and he has just purchased the "Little Shirley Beans" record for his sister:</p>

				<p class="light" style="font-size:14px;text-indent:25px">“But the worst part was that you could tell they all wanted to go to the movies. I couldn't stand looking at them. I can understand somebody going to the movies because there's nothing else to do, but when somebody really wants to go, and even walks fast so as to get there quicker, then it depresses hell out of me. Especially if I see millions of people standing in one of those long, terrible lines, all the way down the block, waiting with this terrific patience for seats and all” (Salinger 116)</p>	
				
				<p class="light" style="font-size:18px">In this quote, Holden is criticizing people who are excited to go to the movies. He has already made it clear previously in the book that he doesn't like movies for reasons like the actors don't act like real people. Now, when he says "but when somebody really wants to go...then it depresses hell out of me", he is explicitly criticizing people for wanting to see them. He doesn't think people should enjoy movies just because he doesn't, which is an arrogant way of thinking. Holden also says "I couldn't stand looking at them." and "it depresses hell out of me", as if their choice to watch movies affects him personally and wrongs him. The idea that the society members' interests affect him personally reveals how passionate Holden is against movies, and how passionately he wants to criticize the people. Overall, this quote is a strong example of social criticism, in this case against the popularity of movies.</p>

				<p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Here's one last example of social crticism made by Holden from the part where he's at Mr. Spencer's house and Mr. Spencer tells him that life is a game: </p>

				<p class="light" style="font-size:14px;text-indent:25px">"He just kept talking about Life being a game and all. You know.
				'Life is a game, boy. Life is a game that one plays according to the rules.' 
				'Yes, sir. I know it is. I know it.'
				Game, my ass. Some game. If you get on the side where all the hot-shots are, then 
				it's a game, all right--I'll admit that. But if you get on the other side, where there aren't 
				any hot-shots, then what's a game about it? Nothing. No game." (Salinger 8)</p>
				
				<p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Mr. Spencer suggests to Holden that life is a game, meaning you can choose what to do, who you will be, and play your life out how you want to as long as you follow the "rules" (like laws). Holden says "If you get on the side where all the hot-shots are, then it's a game, all right--I'll admit that. But if you get on the other side, where there aren't any hot-shots, then what's a game about it? Nothing. No game". He says that life is a game only for the "hot-shots" (popular, priviliged people) but for everyone else there's no game- no fun, no choices, no freedom. This is a social criticism because he is suggesting that the unprivileged, less popular people have a harder life compared to the "hot-shots" in society.</p>

			<h3>Perception vs. Reality</h3>
            <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">One concept that falls under the social criticism of this book is the idea of perception vs. reality. Basically, Holden criticizes people for appearing and acting one way on the outside, but being a different way in reality. The prime example of this is Stradlater. Here's a quote showing Holden criticizing Stradlater for his difference in perception vs. reality:</p>
			
			<p class="light" style="font-size:14px;text-indent:25px">“Stradlater was more of a secret slob. He always looked all right, Stradlater, but for instance, you should've seen the razor he shaved himself with. It was always rusty as hell and full of lather and hairs and crap. He never cleaned it or anything. He always looked good when he was finished fixing himself up, but he was a secret slob anyway, if you knew him the way I did” (Salinger 27). </p>

           <div class="col s12 m6">

          <div class="card red darken-3">
            <div class="card-content white-text">
			
              <span class="card-title" style="font-weight:bold">Perception vs. Reality</span>
              <p>Perception vs. reality is the contrast between what something seems like/is perceived like and what the reality of it actually is.</p>

        </div>

            
          </div>
		  
		  <div class="row">
			<div class="col s12 m12">
			  <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">In this quote, Holden says "He always looked all right, Stradlater" and "He always looked good when he was finished fixing himself up" to show what Stradlater is perceived as- a well groomed, handsome boy. But he says "you should've seen the razor he shaved himself with. It was always rusty as hell and full of lather and hairs and crap. He never cleaned it or anything" and "he was a secret slob" to show what Stradlater's reality is. Stradlater tries fix himself up constantly and look handsome (which he achieves), but in reality he has dirty habits. This is a contrast between how others perceive Stradlater and what the reality of him is, something that Holden criticizes. Perception vs. reality ties back to Holden's hatred of phonies, because phonies are artificial people. People whose perception differs from their reality like Stradlater are also artificial/phony because they seem to be one way but are actually a different way.</div>
