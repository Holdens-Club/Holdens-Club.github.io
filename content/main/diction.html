            <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Diction is the choice/use of words in a literary work. Since Holden is narrating <i>The Catcher in the Rye</i>, Salinger's diction actually represents the kind of language that Holden uses. The type of language Holden uses reveals things about his personality and character which will be discussed here, as well as achieving the Bildungsroman purpose. This page will discuss these topics more in depth.</p>

			<h3>Colloquial Diction</h3>
                 <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Colloquial diction is the use of words which create a conversational tone. In <i>The Catcher in the Rye</i>, colloquial diction creates a conversation between Holden and the reader. Basically, this means Holden addresses the reader and talks to them while narrating.</p>

          </div>

          <div class="row">
            <div class="col s12 m12">
			 <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">As an example of Holden using colloquial diction, take this quote from the first page of the book: </p>
			 
			 <p class="light" style="font-size:14px;text-indent:25px">"If <u>you</u> really want to hear about it, the first thing <u>you'll</u> probably want to know is where I was born..." (Salinger 1)</p>
           
			<p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Because of his use of the word "you" and "you'll", it's clear that Holden is addressing the reader directly and creating a conversation with them, meaning that colloquial diction is being used.</p>
		  
			<p class="light" style="font-size:18px">The deep meaning of colloquial diction in the book is that it gives Holden someone to vent out his beliefs, feelings, and frustrations to. Holden has a few strong beliefs, such as his hatred for phonies / artificial behavior. He also has feelings like loneliness and depression. He wants someone to talk to about them, and the reader is the person he decides to talk to. There are a few examples in the text that make it clear Holden wants to vent out his thoughts.</p>
		   
		    <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Here's one example from Holden's meeting with Luce at the Wicker Bar, after Holden says his sex life "stinks":</p>
			
			<p class="light" style="font-size:14px;text-indent:25px">"Naturally it does, for God's sake. I told you the last time I saw you what you
			need."
			 "You mean to go to a psychoanalyst and all?" I said. That's what he'd told me I
			ought to do. His father was a psychoanalyst and all.
			 "It's up to you, for God's sake. It's none of my goddam business what you do with
			your life."
			 I didn't say anything for a while. I was thinking.
			 "Supposing I went to your father and had him psychoanalyze me and all," I said.
			"What would he do to me? I mean what would he do to me?"
			 "He wouldn't do a goddam thing to you. He'd simply talk to you, and you'd talk to
			him, for God's sake. For one thing, he'd help you to recognize the patterns of your mind." (Salinger 148)
			</p>
			
			 <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">In this quote, Holden seems like he's interested in getting psychoanalyzed. Regarding the idea of going to one, he narrates, "I didn't say anything for a while. I was thinking." and "'Supposing I went to your father and had him psychoanalyze me and all,' I said. 'What would he do to me? I mean what would he do to me?'". He is asking questions about what the psychoanalyst would do to him. Not saying anything for a while because he was thinking shows that he was considering going to a psychoanalyst. Luce establishes what a psychoanalyst does when he says "He'd simply talk to you, and you'd talk to him"- psychoanalysts have patients talk about their experiences and feelings as a way of treating them.  </p>
			
			<p class="light" style="font-size:18px">That's why when Holden shows interest in getting psychoanalyzed, it reveals his desire to vent out his feelings and thoughts to someone. A psychoanalyst would be that person he'd vent out to. Even though Holden does eventually get a psychoanalyst in the end after his breakdown, he also uses the reader as a person to vent to as well by talking to them about everything that happened.</p>
			
			 <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Here's another example of Holden showing his desire to vent out during his date with Sally. When they're at the table in the ice skating rink, he starts spewing out his hatred for New York and phony people:</p>
			 
			 <p class="light" style="font-size:14px;text-indent:25px">"'Well, I hate it. Boy, do I hate it,' I said. 'But it isn't just that. It's everything. I
			hate living in New York and all. Taxicabs, and Madison Avenue buses, with the drivers
			and all always yelling at you to get out at the rear door, and being introduced to phony
			guys that call the Lunts angels, and going up and down in elevators when you just want to
			go outside, and guys fitting your pants all the time at Brooks, and people always--'
			 'Don't shout, please,' old Sally said. Which was very funny, because I wasn't
			even shouting.
			 'Take cars, I said. I said it in this very quiet voice. "Take most people, they're
			crazy about cars. They worry if they get a little scratch on them, and they're always
			talking about how many miles they get to a gallon, and if they get a brand-new car
			already they start thinking about trading it in for one that's even newer. I don't even like
			old cars. I mean they don't even interest me. I'd rather have a goddam horse. A horse is at
			least human, for God's sake. A horse you can at least--'" (Salinger 130-131)
			
			<p class="light" style="font-size:18px">In this quote, Holden is basically finding any random thing to hate about New York city and the phony people in it. This includes "drivers always yelling at you to get out at the rear door", "phony guys that call the Lunts angels", and car enthusiasts. The important thing is that he's venting out all his hatred for everything to Sally. Sally interjects by saying things like "Don't shout, please", but Holden continues to ramble which means he has a strong, passionate desire to vent out these thoughts and frustrations with his life. In the end, he chooses the reader to be the person to talk out his whole story and all his thoughts to, and creates a conversation with the reader in order to do this, using colloquial diction.

			<h3>Informal Diction</h3>
                 <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Informal diction is the use of casual, relaxed, non-elevated language and words that wouldn't be appropriate in a formal setting. Being a teenager, Holden uses informal language almost exclusively throughout the book. 
</p>
				 <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">As an example of Holden using informal language, see the following example:</p>
				 
				 <p class="light" style="font-size:14px;font-indent:25px">"He put my goddam paper down then and looked at me like he'd just beaten hell out of me in ping-pong or something. I don't think I'll ever forgive him for reading me that crap out loud. I wouldn't've read it out loud to him if he'd written it--I really wouldn't. In the first place, I'd only written that damn note so that he wouldn't feel too bad about flunking me" (Salinger 12)</p>

				<p class="light" style="font-size:18px">In this quote, Holden uses profanity such as “crap”, “damn”, “goddam” and “hell”. Words like these are examples of informal diction because cursing is not appropriate in formal situations. He also uses a double contraction (“wouldn't've”), and double contractions are casual words that are not appropriate in formal writing.</p>
				
				<p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Holden curses and uses slang throughout the book as well- it's not just in this one example.</p>
				
				<p class="light" style="font-size:18px">The reason why Salinger made Holden use informal language is to make him seem like a believable teenager. Many teenagers (especially nowadays) curse often and use slang.  Salinger was an adult when he wrote this, so to capture Holden's adolescence, he used things like informal language and cursing. It makes him seem like an actual teenager, and it even makes him relatable to youth today. </p>
				
				<p class="light" style="font-size:18px">By making Holden seem like a teenager, Salinger can make Holden fit in the Bildungsroman purpose of the book. For more explanation about the Bildungsroman purpose in The Catcher in the Rye see this page: <a href="../../content/main/bildungsroman.html">Click Here</a></p>
				
				<p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Since a Bildungsroman story is a coming of age story, you need an adolescent to be the one to mature. If Holden seemed like a formal adult instead of a teenager he wouldn't be able to come of age in the book. The informal language Holden uses contributes to him seeming like a teenager. </p>
				
				<p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Again, for more information and explanation about how the Bildungsroman purpose is present in the book, please see the page: <a href="../../content/main/bildungsroman.html">Click Here</a></p>
