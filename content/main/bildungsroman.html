            <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Another purpose Salinger had while writing <i>The Catcher in the Rye</i> was to make it a Bildungsroman story involving the believeable teenager character Holden. Holden is a very interesting character to make a Bildungsroman story about, though. He resists change and growing up, and wants to preserve children's innocence. These ideas will be discussed in this page.</p>

              <p>A Bildungsroman is a coming of age/adolescence story that looks at a character's growth from being a child to becoming an adult.</p>

		  <div class="row">
			<div class="col s12 m12">
			  <p class="light" style="font-size:18px">To begin, here's an example of Holden "growing up" or maturing in this story, fitting the Bildungsroman purpose. It's at the part where Holden sneaks back to his house and talks with Phoebe, and is about to leave to Mr. Antolini's apartment:</p>
			  
			  <p class="light" style="font-size:14px;text-indent:25px">"'I got my damn bags at the station,' I said. 'Listen. You got any dough, Phoeb?
				I'm practically broke.'...

				She put the dough in my hand...

				 Then, all of a sudden, I started to cry. I couldn't help it. I did it so nobody could
				hear me, but I did it...

				Then I took my hunting hat out of my coat pocket and gave it
				to her. She likes those kind of crazy hats. She didn't want to take it, but I made her. I'll bet
				she slept with it on. She really likes those kind of hats." (Salinger 178-180)</p>
				
				<p class="light" style="font-size:18px">In this quote, Holden asks Phoebe for money and ends up accepting around eight dollars of her Christmas money. Afterwards, he says, "Then, all of a sudden, I started to cry. I couldn't help it". The reason he cried is because he realized how bad his situation is- he has burned through all his money and is at such a low state in his life that he has to accept his 10-year old sister's Christmas money. Previously in this chapter, Phoebe had also called him out on not liking anything. Holden puts this together in addition with having to borrow the money and realizes how immature and irresponsible he has been. Next, Holden says "Then I took my hunting hat out of my coat pocket and gave it to her". This is explained on the <a href="../../content/main/motifs.html">Motifs page</a>, but one thing that Holden's red hunting hat symbolizes is his grasp on childhood and innocence. When he gives up his hat to Phoebe in this quote, he realizes it's time to grow up and move on from his childhood and immaturity. This shows Holden accepting his loss of innocence and he matured as a character after making this realization. This demonstrates a Bildungsroman story as he matured as a character.</p>

				<h3>Holden's Resistance to Becoming of Age</h3>
				<p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Despite <i>The Catcher in the Rye</i> being a Bildungsroman story, Holden actually is opposed to growing up and loss of innocence. He wants to "protect" children from falling into adulthood/losing their innocence in this book. We will demonstrate this using two quotes here. In fact, as you will see, the title of the book, "The Catcher in the Rye", is based on Holden being this "protector".</p>

      		<h5>Holden Protecting Children from Becoming of Age</h5>
				<p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Here's a quote from when Holden visits Phoebe's school to deliver the message to meet him at lunch time:</p>

				<p class="light" style="font-size:14px;text-indent:25px">"But while I was
				sitting down, I saw something that drove me crazy. Somebody'd written 'F*** you' on
				the wall. It drove me damn near crazy. I thought how Phoebe and all the other little kids
				would see it, and how they'd wonder what the hell it meant, and then finally some dirty
				kid would tell them--all cockeyed, naturally--what it meant, and how they'd all think
				about it and maybe even worry about it for a couple of days. I kept wanting to kill
				whoever'd written it. I figured it was some perverty bum that'd sneaked in the school late
				at night to take a leak or something and then wrote it on the wall. I kept picturing myself
				catching him at it, and how I'd smash his head on the stone steps till he was good and
				goddam dead and bloody...But I rubbed it out anyway, finally." (Salinger 201)</p>

				<p class="light" style="font-size:18px">In this quote, Holden found the F word written on a wall in Phoebe's school. He says "It drove me damn near crazy" and talks about how Phoebe and the other young children would see it and find out what it means. He is clearly upset that the kids are being exposed to this level of profanity, and talks about how he wants to brutally kill whoever wrote it. In the end he says "But I rubbed it out anyway, finally". He rubbed out the F word so that the kids wouldn't see it and be exposed to it, meaning he was trying to protect their innocence.</p>

				<p class="light" style="font-size:18px">Here's an earlier quote from when Holden is talking to Phoebe after sneaking home, and describes what he wants to be:</p>

				<p class="light" style="font-size:14px;text-indent:25px">"'Anyway, I keep picturing all
				these little kids playing some game in this big field of rye and all. Thousands of little
				kids, and nobody's around--nobody big, I mean--except me. And I'm standing on the edge
				of some crazy cliff. What I have to do, I have to catch everybody if they start to go over
				the cliff--I mean if they're running and they don't look where they're going I have to come
				out from somewhere and catch them. That's all I'd do all day. I'd just be the catcher in the
				rye and all. I know it's crazy, but that's the only thing I'd really like to be. I know it's
				crazy.'" (Salinger 173)</p>

				<p class="light" style="font-size:18px">In this quote, Holden says he would like to catch "little kids" who are "running and they don't look where they're going" and "start to go over the cliff". Going over the cliff for the kids means going into adulthood and moving on from their childhood and innocence. By the kids not looking where they're going while running, Holden means children grow into adults and gradually lose their innocence without even realizing it or knowing what's happening to them. He wants to catch them from falling off the cliff, meaning he wants to save them from falling into adulthood. He is again showing that he wants to preserve and protect children and their innocence in this quote, meaning he is opposed to becoming of age / the idea of a Bildungsroman- he is opposed to children growing up.</p>

				<br></br>
				<h5>Holden's Own Resistance to Growing Up Himself</h5>

				<p class="light" style="font-size:18px">In addition to wanting to protect children and prevent them from growing up/losing their innocence, Holden himself doesn't want to grow up either. Here is a quote from chapter 16 where Holden is reflecting on the Museum of Natural History and how everything in it always stays the same:</p>

				<p class="light" style="font-size:14px;text-indent:25px">"The
				best thing, though, in that museum was that everything always stayed right where it was.
				Nobody'd move. You could go there a hundred thousand times, and that Eskimo would
				still be just finished catching those two fish, the birds would still be on their way south,
				the deers would still be drinking out of that water hole, with their pretty antlers and their
				pretty, skinny legs, and that squaw with the naked bosom would still be weaving that
				same blanket. Nobody'd be different. The only thing that would be different would be
				you." (Salinger 121)</p>

				<p class="light" style="font-size:18px">In this quote, Holden explicitly talks about how he likes how the museum's attractions and displays always stay the same no matter how many times you go or how much time passes. This is happening while he himself is changing/growing ("The only thing that would be different would be you"). This shows that he doesn't like change and growth in his life, and would rather stay constant like the museum objects, living his childhood forever without having to become an adult. This quote is one piece of evidence suggesting that Holden doesn't want to grow up himself and lose his childhood/innocence, which is a part of his opposition to becoming of age/Bildungsroman.</p>
